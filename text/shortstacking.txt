SHORTSTACKING

Last updated: 20180816

Imagine you've got a friend who has played some NLH Tournaments
at the Pub/Club level and now wants to try Cash NLH at the Casino.
What kind of playing advice would you give him? I'd suggest that he
  - buys in for the minimum $100
  - waits for premium pairs and high suited cards
  - raises with these big cards preflop to thin the field and make
    for easier postflop decisions
  - set mines with 55-88, raise/call with 99-JJ, bet/raise with QQ,KK,AA,AK
  - cash out and leave if he can get his stack above $300.

There's a few poker books suggesting this strategy for beginning
players, one of the best is "Getting Started in Hold'em" by Ed Miller.
As you gain more experience and poker feel you add low pairs, more
speculative hands, bigger buyins and more positional awareness.

A similar approach is possible in PLO, but it's actually a sophisticated
approach that many experienced players use. It's called "Shortstacking"
because it involves buyin in for a pretty small stack, relative to the
other players and the maximum allowed buyin. Here's the essence of
the shortstacking approach:
  - buy in for the minimum or a bit more ($100-$175)
  - sit to the right of the most aggressive player
  - look to limp-raise or check-raise him with all your strong hands.
  - cash out and leave if he can get his stack above $400

The seat you get (if it becomes available) is called the Rolf Seat,
after Rolf Slotboom who developed this style of play for his
own game.

You know in Tournament No Limit Holdem where someone is all-in preflop
for not much and there's three callers and all those callers check
the flop, check the turn and check the river, to maximise the chance
the all-in player gets busted by one of them? That doesn't happen
in cash games and it happens even less in PLO cash games. Busting
players isn't important in cash (the busted player can simply rebuy)
the most important thing is fighting over the real cash money
that's already in this pot. So an all-in player (which
a shortstacker will frequently be either preflop or on the flop) is often
given protection by a bigger stack who jams the flop and forces
out other players who would've ended up an unlikely winner had they
stayed in. Meanwhile the all-in shortstacker wins his main pot
with a two-pair or a set that the jammer loses to.

This doesn't happen all the time of course, often the deepstack
jammer wins the side pot and also the main pot with some
monster unbeatable hand. But the protection does save the
shortstack all-in player often enough for it to be a
noticeable part of the shortstack's advantage. Plus,
even when the shortstack player does lose, it's only
cost him the amount of his short stack. It's not a crushing
$450 loss of a big stack, it's an annoying loss of a $120
short stack.

Protection means that the shortstacker is playing for a pot
that's larger than the money he's had to put in, relative
to the number of players he has to beat. He could be all in
for $30 into a $120 pot, but only has to beat 2 other players
(a third $30 caller has since been blasted off because of further
jamming by the still-active players). In extreme cases an all-in
player could be getting 6 to 1 on his money and only have
to beat a single player heads-up. That's an excellent result
for the shortstacker.

Just because a player is making min buyin after min buyin doesn't
mean that's he's using or understanding the Shortstacking approach.
He could simply be running bad and doesn't want to lose
big buyin after big buyin, he'll take four more $100 shots
and if none of them work he's done for the night. Playing this
way instead of trying two $200 shorts or a $300 shot followed
by a $100 shot is smart money management and maximises the
number of buyins that can come good.

I've seen a lot of passive players make these min buyins and
some of them call preflop bets to $10, $20 or $40 and they're
using at least one fifth of their stack each time. These
are like passive tournament players who let their stack get
too small before taking a stand, I call them deadstack nothreats.

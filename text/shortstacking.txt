SHORTSTACKING

Last updated: 20180813

Imagine you've got a friend who has played some NLH Tournaments
at the Pub/Club level and now wants to try Cash NLH at the Casino.
What kind of playing advice would you give him? I'd suggest that he
  - buys in for the minimum $100
  - waits for premium pairs and high suited cards
  - raises with these big cards preflop to thin the field and make
    for easier postflop decisions
  - set mines with 55-88, raise/call with 99-JJ, bet/raise with QQ,KK,AA,AK

There's a few poker books suggesting this strategy for beginning
players, one of the best is "Getting Started in Hold'em" by Ed Miller.
As you gain more experience and poker feel you add low pairs, more
speculative hands, bigger buyins and more positional awareness.

A similar approach is possible in PLO, but it's actually a sophisticated
approach that many experienced players use. It's called "Shortstacking"
because it involves buyin in for a pretty small stack, relative to the
other players and the maximum allowed buyin. Here's the essence of
the shortstacking approach:
  - buy in for the minimum or a bit more ($100-$175)
  - sit to the right of the most aggressive player
  - look to limp-raise or check-raise him with all your strong hands.

The seat you get (if it becomes available) is called the Rolf Seat,
after Rolf Slotboom who used and wrote all about Shortstacking.

You know in Tournament No Limit Holdem where someone is all-in preflop
for not much and there's three callers and all those callers check
the flop, check the turn and check the river, to maximise the chance
the the all-in player gets busted by one of them? That doesn't happen
in cash games and it happens even less in PLO cash games. Busting
players isn't important in cash (the busted player can simply rebuy)
the most important thing is fighting over the real cash money
that's already in the pot. So an all-in player (which
a shortstacker will frequently be either preflop or on the flop) is often
given protection by a bigger stack who jams the flop and forces
out other players who would've been the unlikely winner had they
stayed in. Meanwhile the all-in shortstacker wins his main pot
with a two-pair or set hand that the jammer loses to.

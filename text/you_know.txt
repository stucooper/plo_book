YOU KNOW HOLDEM SO YOU KNOW OMAHA

Last updated: 20190303

I deliberately lied in the name of this chapter. No Limit Holdem
and Pot Limit Omaha are very different games. Just about the only
things they have in common are the number of betting rounds and
the community cards produced at each phase.

  Players dealt unique hole cards
  Preflop Betting
  3 card flop produced
  Postflop Betting
  4th card ("turn") prouduced
  Postturn Betting
  5th card ("river") produced
  Final Betting
  Showdown

In both games, the hand ends prematurely if one player bets all
the other players out of the pot and nobody is all-in.

Because PLO betting rounds are Pot Limit not No Limit, they play
very differently. You can't shove all-in with a giant overbet and
take the pot down or get heads-up with one player. It's quite common
in Omaha for 4 or even 5 players to still be live on the flop.

The Omaha Showdown Rule: 2+3
============================

In Texas you can use 2, 1 or even none of your hole cards in combination
with the 5 community cards to make your best 5 card poker hands. If the
final community is AKQJT, no flush possible, then everyone still in the
hand has an unbeatable Ace-high straight (called "Broadway"). Poker
legend has it that in the 2005 World Series Main Event, four players
were in a hand with this board. One player bet, the next player
raised, two Internet qualifiers folded and it ended up being a 2-way
split not a 4-way split!

In Omaha you've got to use 2 cards of your own and 3 from the Board, a
showdown rule I call 2+3. This changes the hands you can make.
In Texas a board of T8632 four Diamonds will usually see the winner
holding a single high Diamond. In Omaha, you need 2 Diamonds of your
own to make the flush here.

More 2+3 confusion occurs with double-paired Boards. In Texas if I have
AK on a board of KK884 then I have a full house KKK88. But in Omaha
I don't - I have trip Kings. With a holding of AKQT and a board of
KK884 my best hand is [AK]KK8 for KKKA8. I'm showing the 2 cards I'm
using in square brackets [] here. Once I've used my two cards there's
no room in the board 3 to include both those KK88 to fill up.

In Omaha it's harder to have a fullhouse on the board of KK884 than it
is on KK864. On KK884 to make a fullhouse a player needs both cards
K8,K4,84 or 44. The 8 repeating on the turn doesn't change whether a
player has a full house; a player must have flopped a full house to
have it on the turn. In the same way, a fourth flush card on the turn
doesn't change if a player has a flush. There are no "one-card
flushes" or "one-card full houses" in Omaha.

When there's three of a kind on the Board, you need a pocket pair in
your own holding to make a full house. Holding AKQT to a board of K8883,
my best hand is [AK]888 and I don't have a full house. Someone with
JT99 beats me because his best hand is [99]888. Of course in both
Omaha and Texas, someone with the fourth 8 in their holding makes Quads
and wins.

The 2+3 Showdown Rule takes a lot of getting used to. One of
the advantages an experienced Omaha player has against a Holdemite is
experience in 2+3 Board reading. The Holdemite misreads the board
a lot and ends up calling with full houses that aren't, flushes that
aren't and even straights that aren't. This is great for the Omaha
regular and very costly for the Holdemite.

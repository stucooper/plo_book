YOU KNOW HOLDEM SO YOU KNOW OMAHA

I deliberately lied in the naming of this chapter. No Limit Holdem
and Pot LImit Omaha are very different games. Just about the only
things they have in common are the number of betting rounds and 
the community cards produced at each phase.

  Preflop Betting
  3 card flop produced
  Postflop Betting
  4th card ("turn") prouduced
  Postturn Betting
  5th card ("river") produced
  Final Betting
  Showdown

Because the betting rounds are Pot Limit not No Limit, they play
very differently. You can't shove all-in with a giant overbet and 
take the pot down or get heads-up with one player. It's quite common
in Omaha for 4 or even 5 players to still be live on the flop.

Omaha Showdown Rules: 2+3
=========================

In Holdem you can use 2, 1 or even none of your hole cards in combination
with the 5 community cards to make your best 5 card poker hands. If the
final community is AKQJT, no flush possible, then everyone still in the
hand has an unbeatable Ace-high straight (called "Broadway"). Poker
legend has it that in the 2005 World Series Main Event, four players
were in a hand with this board. One player bet, the next player
raised, two Internet qualifiers folded and it ended up being a 2-way
split not a 4-way split!

In Omaha you've got to use 2 cards of your own and 3 from the Board, a
showdown rule which I'll call 2+3. This changes the hands you can make.
In Texas a board of T8632 four Diamonds will usually see the winner
holding a single high Diamond. In Omaha, you need 2 Diamonds of your
own to make the flush here. 

More 2+3 confusion occurs with double-paired Boards. In Texas if I have
AK on a board of KK884 then I have a full house AKK88. But in Omaha
I don't - I have trip Kings. With a holding of AKQT and a board of 
KK884 my best hand is [AK]KK8 for KKKA8. I'm showing the 2 cards I'm
using in square brackets [] here. Once I've used my two cards there's
no room in the board 3 to include both those KK88 to fill up.

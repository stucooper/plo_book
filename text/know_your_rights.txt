KNOW YOUR RIGHTS

Last updated: 20180725

Poker dealers do their best to run a good and fair game,
but their main interest is in keeping the game running
quickly. Just like the players, the dealers make mistakes.
You have to stick up for your rights at the poker table.
The following rules of the game are the ones I've found
through experience to be those that I have to ask to be
enforced the most.

1) English only at the table
----------------------------

There's a lot of Asian players and they'll talk to each
other in Chinese if they're allowed to. They're not.
Not even between hands or during the next deal. A good
supervisor will enforce this. Collusion in poker and
information passing can happen at any time during a
poker session.

2) One player to a hand
-----------------------

Unless a player is obviously folding or is already all-in
(no further action on his part) he shouldn't be showing
his card to other players, and NEVER to other active players.
There's an Omaha tradition of flashing your cards to folded
players on your right, just before you fold. Often you're
frustratingly showing a good holding that completely whiffed.
You have JJT9 Double Red and the flop comes A84 all black.

Sometimes a player is still thoughtful and is flashing his cards
to others without having committed to folding. The other players
remember what they folded and might give information like
"I folded a six, don't draw to that" or "I folded three diamonds,
that flush draw is no use". Whenever this looks like happening,
I'll announce "One player to a hand!"

3) Players have to read their own Board
---------------------------------------

Reading the Board yourself is a critical skill in both Holdem
and Omaha. If you table your hand, "Cards speak" and the
dealer and other players can assist in finding your best
poker hand, but unless you table your hand, you're on your own.

Sometimes I've bet on the river and been called and I table
a far-from-Nut hand like a so-so two pair. The calling player
is looking at his hand for a while, not wishing to show a loser
if he can't find a winner. Some dealers, to speed things up,
will mention the winning cards and winning hands possible on this
board, and assist that player in his tabling decision.

These dealers are COMPLETELY OUT OF LINE. It is the player's
responsibility to read the board at every stage, including the
finalboard. It is solely the player's decision to table his hand
or not.

If you're the winner of a pot, and the calling player flashed
his cards to others but still folded, never ask what his cards
were, even though you have a right to that information under
the "Show one, Show All" stipulation. In some rule interpretations,
if the winner asks for a mucked showdown hand to be revealed then
THAT HAND BECOMES LIVE AGAIN! There's a tiny but non-zero chance
that the mucker has folded a winner or a hand that could split the pot.
Just accept this pot and stack your chips.

4) Three Hundred Max Buyin
--------------------------

Some of the maniacs and Five-Five Refugees sometimes try to buy in
for more than the $300 maximum. If they've got a pitiful $8 or so
in $1 chips I don't mind if they add on three black $100 chips but if they
have as little as $15 and try to add on to $315 then I'll stop them
and get it rounded down to $300. Rules are rules.

5) Check the Showdown winner
----------------------------

Take a moment to check the Showdown winner is indeed the winning
hand you think it is, and remember 2+3 Showdown rules. Check all
5 cards of the winning hand. There will be table pressure on you
to move the game along to the next hand but your money is at stake
and you've got the right to be absolutely sure that the other player
has won this showdown fairly and squarely.

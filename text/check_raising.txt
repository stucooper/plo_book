CHECK RAISING TO LIMIT THE FIELD

In the last chapter I wrote about an old idea from Fixed Limit Poker,
the Free Card Play. In this chapter I look at another idea from Fixed
Limit, Check Raising to limit the field.

In a 10/20 Limit game a lot of players will call $10 preflop and hope
to see a flop for that price. If you're under the gun and make it $20
preflop you might lose the weakest hands but a lot of players will still
call the $20.

Your best chance to limit the field is to go for a check-raise. You limp
for $10, a bunch of players also limp and the button raises to $20. You
now re-raise to $30 and the $10 limpers face the prospect of wasting
at least another $20 to see a flop and possibly $30 if the button
re-re-raises and caps it at $40.

So an original bet of yours won't limit the field much, but if you
can get a check-raise in you'll lose some enemies.

Because you can only bet the size of the pot, similar considerations apply
in PLO. You can only raise to $10 under the gun in 1/3 PLO but if you limp
for 3 and there's a whole bunch of limpers and the button raises to 30
you can suddenly re-raise to 100 and now you'll force people out.

On the flop, you'll want to limit the field with hands as strong
as top set. If you can only bet $70 you'll get a lot of callers but if
you can get a check raise in to $250 or $280 you'll have a great chance
to get heads up and protect your hand.

If the flop is superdry you're better off betting out; if you've got
KK on a K83 flop just bet it yourself and pray someone has a lower set
and will reraise to protect their "winner". On wet boards, try for the
check-raise more often than not.

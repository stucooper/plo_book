RAINY DAY EXERCISE

Last updated: 20180812

Next time you're stuck at home on a rainy day with nowhere to go
and nothing to do, try this Rainy Day Exercise. It'll take about
an hour but it will be an hour very well spent. You'll
need a deck of cards and three coins; a 50 cent, 20 cent and 10 cent coin.

Got all of those? Great. What you'll be doing in this exercise is
dealing 10 Omaha holdings face up. You'll pause to have a look at
each Omaha holding and rate it. Just by looking at Omaha holdings
at a full table for 10 deals you'll start to find some patterns
and get an idea of which holdings are good and which holdings aren't.

You can read about what I think about Omaha holdings and nod-along
with what I'm saying, but if you do this Rainy Day Exercise you'll
see it for yourself. That's why I'm asking you to spend an hour doing it.
You need to see it to believe it. 10 deals of 10 players, with
a shuffle in between each deal.

Lessons of Omaha holdings, ten handed
=====================================

1) A suited king is often behind to a suited Ace in someone else's hand.
In a few of my deals, KKxy double suited was beaten in both suits!
Remember this important fact - a suited King is often losing and
can lose big to the nut flush if the flush comes.

2) A player with a pocket pair often has no chance of making a set,
because the cards he needs are in the other holdings and can't
be on the board. Our player doesn't know that of course, and plays
his hand assuming his set chances are live.

3) There's a lot of pocket pairs in the 10 holdings. Most deals you'll
see 4 or 5 pocket pairs. Can you see how often set under set can happen?
If you've got 6654, there's a great chance in a 10-handed deal that
there's two pocket pairs higher than yours taking the flop. Two, three or
four of the pairs AA,KK,QQ,JJ,TT,99,88,77 are out there. When the
flop comes Q96, don't be surprised if your bottom set is smoked against
QQ or 99, or even both.

Pick the winner
===============

Now that you've seen all the holdings, and before you deal the 
flop/turn/river, try and pick the winner of this hand. Put the 
50 cent coin on the holding you think has the best chance of 
winning, the 20 cent coin on your number 2 pick and the 10 cent 
coin on your number 3 pick. You have the advantage
of seeing all 40 cards in the holdings, so you might discount 
a strong hand like AAK9 two hearts because you can see the 
other two Aces are in other holdings and there's 7 other hearts
out already.

Once you've picked your top 3 chances, run the board. How strong
was the winning hand? Did you pick it? Was the winning hand
the Nuts for this board? Was the winning hand something that
shouldn't have been played because it was a trash hand?

Here's the results of my ten-deal Rainy Day Exercise

DEAL 1
======
Seat 1:  AcQT4c    Seat 2: AdQT2d  Seat 3: JsJT6s
Seat 4:  7c6c6d3d  Seat 5: K83c2c  Seat 6: AhK92h
Seat 7:  JJ85      Seat 8: T98s7s  Seat 9: As954s
Seat 10: Q43s2s

Preflop comment: All nut flush chances are present in this deal,
Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades. Seat 4, with a nice looking
double-suited 7663, is dead in flushes in both suits. The two JJ
hands (Seats 3 and 7) can't make a set; they have each other's out.
Seat 8 (T987) looks to be a great chance, although three of the
sixes are accounted for.

Unplayable: Seat 5 (K832) and Seat 10 (Q432).

Best chance: Seat 8 (T98s7s)
Second best: Seat 6 (AhK92h)
Third best:  Seat 1 (AcQT4c)

Flop: 7h5h4h. This is an instant win for Seat 6, who should bet to
protecht his hand. Hearts were the only flush suit where nobody
else had dominated flush cards, so Seat 6 won't get much action.

Full runout: 5h7h4h,9d,7d. Seat 8, T987, makes a good full house
on the end but wouldn't have stayed in the hand in the face of
Seat 6's flop bet.

DEAL 2
======
Seat 1:  Th7d6h2d  Seat 2: Td9d94   Seat 3: Q742
Seat 4:  Tc6c32c   Seat 5: K533     Seat 6: J65s4s
Seat 7:  AK73      Seat 8: AsATs8   Seat 9: Q99c4c
Seat 10: Qcjs6s5c

Preflop comment: The hands here aren't as strong as in Deal 1.
Seats 1,3,4,5 and 7 shouldn't take a flop.  Seat 10 has a
seductive hand, double suited with two different connectors;
QJ and 54.  Like in Deal 1, two players have the same pocket pair;
here Seat 2 and Seat 9 both have 99.

Best chance: Seat 8: AAT8
Second best: Seat 10: QJ65
Third best:  Seat 6:  J654

Flop: KK5

A dope flop to excite seats 5 and 7, if they'd stayed in. Notice
that K533 would see a flop mostly to flop a set of threes but
ends up flopping a full house with his unrelated cards.

Runout: KK572. Seat 7 outdraws Seat 5; his AK73 making a better
full house, using his K7 to make the better full house than the
flopped K5 full.

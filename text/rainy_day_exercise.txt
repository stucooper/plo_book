RAINY DAY EXERCISE

Last updated: 20180812

Next time you're stuck at home on a rainy day with nowhere to go
and nothing to do, try this Rainy Day Exercise. It'll take about
an hour but it will be an hour very well spent. You'll
need a deck of cards and three coins; a 50 cent, 20 cent and 10 cent coin.

Got all of those? Great. What you'll be doing in this exercise is
dealing 10 Omaha holdings face up. You'll pause to have a look at
each Omaha holding and rate it. Just by looking at Omaha holdings
at a full table for 10 deals you'll start to find some patterns
and get an idea of which holdings are good and which holdings aren't.

You can read about what I think about Omaha holdings and nod-along
with what I'm saying, but if you do this Rainy Day Exercise you'll
see it for yourself. That's why I'm asking you to spend an hour doing it.
You need to see it to believe it. 10 deals of 10 players, with
a shuffle in between each deal.

Lessons of Omaha holdings, ten handed
=====================================

1) A suited king is often behind to a suited Ace in someone else's hand.
In a few of my deals, KKxy double suited was beaten in both suits!
Remember this important fact - a suited King is often losing and
can lose big to the nut flush if the flush comes.

2) A player with a pocket pair often has no chance of making a set,
because the cards he needs are in the other holdings and can't
be on the board. Our player doesn't know that of course, and plays
his hand assuming his set chances are live.

3) There's a lot of pocket pairs in the 10 holdings. Most deals you'll
see 4 or 5 pocket pairs. Can you see how often set under set can happen?
If you've got 6654, there's a great chance in a 10-handed deal that
there's two pocket pairs higher than yours taking the flop. Two, three or
four of the pairs AA,KK,QQ,JJ,TT,99,88,77 are out there. When the
flop comes Q96, don't be surprised if your bottom set is smoked against
QQ or 99, or even both.

Pick the winner
===============

Now that you've seen all the holdings, and before you deal the 
flop/turn/river, try and pick the winner of this hand. Put the 
50 cent coin on the holding you think has the best chance of 
winning, the 20 cent coin on your number 2 pick and the 10 cent 
coin on your number 3 pick. You have the advantage
of seeing all 40 cards in the holdings, so you might discount 
a strong hand like AAK9 two hearts because you can see the 
other two Aces are in other holdings and there's 7 other hearts
out already.

Once you've picked your top 3 chances, run the board. How strong
was the winning hand? Did you pick it? Was the winning hand
the Nuts for this board? Was the winning hand something that
shouldn't have been played because it was a trash hand?

Here are the results of my ten-deal Rainy Day Exercise. I'll
present each deal as is, and then draw some conclusions
about Full Ring Omaha after the 10 deals.

DEAL 1
======
Seat 1:  AcQT4c    Seat 2: AdQT2d  Seat 3: JsJT6s
Seat 4:  7c6c6d3d  Seat 5: K83c2c  Seat 6: AhK92h
Seat 7:  JJ85      Seat 8: T98s7s  Seat 9: As954s
Seat 10: Q43s2s

Preflop comment: All nut flush chances are present in this deal,
Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades. Seat 4, with a nice looking
double-suited 7663, is dead in flushes in both suits. The two JJ
hands (Seats 3 and 7) can't make a set; they have each other's out.
Seat 8 (T987) looks to be a great chance, although three of the
sixes are accounted for.

Unplayable: Seat 5 (K832) and Seat 10 (Q432).

Best chance: Seat 8 (T98s7s)
Second best: Seat 6 (AhK92h)
Third best:  Seat 1 (AcQT4c)

Flop: 7h5h4h. This is an instant win for Seat 6, who should bet to
protecht his hand. Hearts were the only flush suit where nobody
else had dominated flush cards, so Seat 6 won't get much action.

Full runout: 5h7h4h,9d,7d. Seat 8, T987, makes a good full house
on the end but wouldn't have stayed in the hand in the face of
Seat 6's flop bet.

DEAL 2
======
Seat 1:  Th7d6h2d  Seat 2: Td9d94   Seat 3: Q742
Seat 4:  Tc6c32c   Seat 5: K533     Seat 6: J65s4s
Seat 7:  AK73      Seat 8: AsATs8   Seat 9: Q99c4c
Seat 10: Qcjs6s5c

Preflop comment: The hands here aren't as strong as in Deal 1.
Seats 1,3,4,5 and 7 shouldn't take a flop.  Seat 10 has a
seductive hand, double suited with two different connectors;
QJ and 54.  Like in Deal 1, two players have the same pocket pair;
here Seat 2 and Seat 9 both have 99.

Best chance: Seat 8: AAT8
Second best: Seat 10: QJ65
Third best:  Seat 6:  J654

Flop: KK5

A dope flop to excite seats 5 and 7, if they'd stayed in. Notice
that K533 would see a flop mostly to flop a set of threes but
ends up flopping a full house with his unrelated cards.

Runout: KK572. Seat 7 outdraws Seat 5; his AK73 making a better
full house, using his K7 to make the better full house than the
flopped K5 full.

DEAL 3:
Seat 1:  AQhQ3h  Seat 2: AsKh6s4h   Seat 3: AQs97s
Seat 4:  J85h2h  Seat 5: 6c43c3     Seat 6: KcT4c3
Seat 7:  TTc85c  Seat 8: J9d7d5     Seat 9: Js9s8s4s
Seat 10: AK22

Preflop comment: Seat 1 (AQQ3) has a nice hand with a big set chances
(we can see one of his Queens is live) and high flush chances. Seat 2
is also nice. Seat 4 (J85h2h) seat 6 (KcT4c3) and seat 10 (AK22)
should fold.

Flop: Qd8d6d. Another single-suit flop but top set for QQQ. Seat 8
has flopped a small 9-high flush with an open-ended straight flush draw.
In a betting situation this hand will be a battle between Seat 1 and
Seat 8.

Runout: Qd8d6d75d. The Straight flush gets there! On the river
QQQ won't call much (he can't even beat a straight) but might
make a small crying call out of frustration that his top set
couldn't find a repeater.

DEAL 4:
Seat 1:  7h5s4h3s  Seat 2: AJ96     Seat 3: T8s86s
Seat 4:  T432      Seat 5: J6c5c2c  Seat 6: J873
Seat 7:  QdJTd5d   Seat 8: Th865h   Seat 9: KKsQsQ
Seat 10: AdK93d

Preflop comment: Seat 9 has the fantastic KKsQsQ and should be
looking to pile in bets and raises preflop. He has a live
King and a live Queen. The live King is the King of Diamonds
so it's possible this hand will be a battle between a flopped
set of Kings for Seat 9 against a diamond flush draw for Seat 10.
Unplayable hands: Seat 2 (AJ96) seat 5 (J652) seat 4 (T432)

Flop: 4s42s. A dope flop that makes a full house for Seat 4,
trip 4s with an open ended straight flush draw for Seat 1,
a King high flush draw (dead to the full house) and 2 better
full house outs for KKQQ and not much for anyone else.

Runout: 4s42s97s. The KKQQ misses the better full house, and
the open ended straight flush draw rivers a better full house, 44477.
This is why T432 is unplayable.. even when it gets the miracle flop
it can still get outdrawn. Bad luck for Seat 9 who had a really
good starting hand but didn't connect with that dope flop.

DEAL 5:
Seat 1:  Ad8d62d   Seat 2: AsTc7c4s   Seat 3: 987h3h
Seat 4:  Q85s3s    Seat 5: AcJcJ4     Seat 6: Qc995c
Seat 7:  KT62      Seat 8: J954       Seat 9: Kc3c32
Seat 10: KsQsQ7

Preflop comment: Some nice hands here, nut flush chances in
Diamonds, Spades and Clubs. Seat 5 has a nice chance at a set of Jacks
or the Club flush. Seat 10 has a great looking holding (KsQsQ7)
but doesn't know that he's no chance of a set of Queens and his
King-high spades are beaten by Seat 2's Ace-high spades. Hands
that should fold here are Seat 4 (Q85s3s), Seat 7 (KT62),
Seat 8 (J954) and Seat 9 (Kc3c32). With all the info we can see,
we'd fold seat 10 also but don't blame him for taking a flop!

Flop: 6s42s. A flopped straight and straight-flush chance for Seat 4,
Ace high flush chance for Seat 2, King high (losing) flush chance for
Seat 10 and 2-pair 6622 for Seat 1.

Turn: Ah. Three-pair now for Seat 1, no change to the other hands.

River: Jh. The Straight holds for Seat 4.

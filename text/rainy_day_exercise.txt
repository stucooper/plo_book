RAINY DAY EXERCISE

Last updated: 20180901

Next time you're stuck at home on a rainy day with nowhere to go
and nothing to do, try this Rainy Day Exercise. Stop looking
at the Apps on your mobile phone and spend a while disconnected
from everyone else. The Rainy Day Exercise will take about
an hour but it will be an hour very well spent. You'll
need a deck of cards and three coins; a 50 cent, 20 cent and 10 cent coin.

Got all of those? Great. What you'll be doing in this exercise is
dealing 10 Omaha holdings face up. You'll pause to have a look at
each Omaha holding and rate it. Just by looking at Omaha holdings
at a full table for 10 deals you'll start to find some patterns
and get an idea of which holdings are good and which holdings aren't.

You can read about what I think about Omaha holdings and nod-along
with what I'm saying, but if you do this Rainy Day Exercise you'll
see it for yourself. That's why I'm asking you to spend an hour doing it.
You need to see it to believe it. And when you see it for yourself,
the message will really sink in. So you're going to do 10 deals
to 10 players, with a shuffle in between each deal.

Lessons of Omaha holdings, ten handed
=====================================

1) A suited king is often behind to a suited Ace in someone else's hand.
In a few of my deals, KKxy double suited was beaten in both suits!
Remember this important fact - a suited King is often already behind and
will lose big to the nut flush if the flush comes.

2) A player with a pocket pair often has no chance of making a set,
because the cards he needs are in the other holdings and can't
be on the board. Our player doesn't know that of course, and plays
his hand assuming his set chances are live.

3) There's a lot of pocket pairs in the 10 holdings. Most deals you'll
see 4 or 5 pocket pairs. Can you see how often set under set can happen?
If you've got 6654, there's a great chance in a 10-handed deal that
there's two pocket pairs higher than yours taking the flop. Two, three or
four of the pairs AA,KK,QQ,JJ,TT,99,88,77 are out there. When the
flop comes Q96, don't be surprised if your bottom set is smoked against
QQ or 99, or even both.

Pick the winner
===============

Now that you've seen all the holdings, and before you deal the
flop/turn/river, try and pick the winner of this hand. Put the
50 cent coin on the holding you think has the best chance of
winning, the 20 cent coin on your number 2 pick and the 10 cent
coin on your number 3 pick. You have the advantage
of seeing all 40 cards in the holdings, so you might discount
a strong hand like AAK9 two hearts because you can see the
other two Aces are in other holdings and there's 7 other hearts
out already.

Once you've picked your top 3 chances, run the board. How strong
was the winning hand? Did you pick it? Was the winning hand
the Nuts for this board? Was the winning hand something that
shouldn't have been played because it was a trash hand?

Here are the results of my Ten Deal Rainy Day Exercise.
Because I'm writing up each deal I didn't do these ten
deals all at once in a single hour, I spread the writing
and the deals over a few sessions. All of the deals are
real, the deck is hand shuffled quite well between each
hand. You'll be able to do the ten deals in an hour quite
easily (since you're not writing down the hands and then
typing them up as part of a poker book you're writing like I am)
and you'll see the same patters as what I see in my ten deals.

I'll present each deal one by one, and then draw some conclusions
about Full Ring Omaha after the 10 deals.

DEAL 1
======
Seat 1:  AcQT4c    Seat 2: AdQT2d  Seat 3: JsJT6s
Seat 4:  7c6c6d3d  Seat 5: K83c2c  Seat 6: AhK92h
Seat 7:  JJ85      Seat 8: T98s7s  Seat 9: As954s
Seat 10: Q43s2s

Preflop comment: All nut flush chances are present in this deal,
Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades. Seat 4, with a nice looking
double-suited 7663, is dead in flushes in both suits. The two JJ
hands (Seats 3 and 7) can't make a set; they have each other's out.
Seat 8 (T987) looks to be a great chance, although three of the
sixes are accounted for.

Unplayable: Seat 5 (K832) and Seat 10 (Q432).

Best chance: Seat 8 (T98s7s)
Second best: Seat 6 (AhK92h)
Third best:  Seat 1 (AcQT4c)

Flop: 7h5h4h. This is an instant win for Seat 6, who should bet to
protect his hand. Hearts were the only flush suit where nobody
else had dominated flush cards, so Seat 6 won't get much action.

Full runout: 5h7h4h,9d,7d. Seat 8, T987, makes a good full house
on the end but wouldn't have stayed in the hand in the face of
Seat 6's flop bet. This is why you come out blasting even with
the flopped nut flush, because if you play it slow and the board
pairs, someone who had no business being in this pot ends up
improbably beating you. When someone turns a nothing hand into
a full house, I call it "luckboating".

DEAL 2
======
Seat 1:  Th7d6h2d  Seat 2: Td9d94   Seat 3: Q742
Seat 4:  Tc6c32c   Seat 5: K533     Seat 6: J65s4s
Seat 7:  AK73      Seat 8: AsATs8   Seat 9: Q99c4c
Seat 10: Qcjs6s5c

Preflop comment: Besides Seat 8's single suited Aces AAT8, the hands
here aren't as strong as in Deal 1.
Seats 1,3,4,5 and 7 shouldn't take a flop.  Seat 10 has a
seductive hand, double suited with two different connectors;
QJ and 54.  Like in Deal 1, two players have the same pocket pair;
here Seat 2 and Seat 9 both have 99.

Best chance: Seat 8: AAT8
Second best: Seat 10: QJ65
Third best:  Seat 6:  J654

Flop: KK5

A dope flop to excite seats 5 and 7, if they'd stayed in. Notice
that K533 would see a flop mostly to flop a set of threes but
ends up flopping a full house with his other two, unrelated, cards.
This happens a lot in Omaha, even when you've got Aces you sometimes
end up using your other two cards, a lot of the time you're in a big
pot with AA86 and end up using the 86 to make a straight. There's
Good Aces and Bad Aces, the Good Aces have more possibilities
(nut flush draws, straight chances) going in their side cards
compared to the Bad Aces (AA72 Badugi is a Bad Aces hand).

Runout: KK572. Seat 7 outdraws Seat 5; his AK73 making a better
full house, using his K7 to make the better full house than the
flopped K5 full. This is a pattern you see often in Omaha on
flops with a pair on them, one player with a full house gets run
down by a player with better side cards making a better full house.

DEAL 3:
Seat 1:  AQhQ3h    Seat 2: AsKh6s4h Seat 3: AQs97s
Seat 4:  J85h2h    Seat 5: 6c43c3   Seat 6: KcT4c3
Seat 7:  TTc85c    Seat 8: J9d7d5   Seat 9: Js9s8s4s
Seat 10: AK22

Preflop comment: Seat 1 (AQQ3) has a nice hand with a big set chances
(we can see one of his Queens is live) and high flush chances. Seat 2
is also nice. Seat 4 (J85h2h) seat 6 (KcT4c3) and seat 10 (AK22)
should fold.

Flop: Qd8d6d. Another single-suit flop but top set for QQQ. Seat 8
has flopped a small 9-high flush with an open-ended straight flush draw.
In a betting situation this hand will be a battle between Seat 1 and
Seat 8.

Runout: Qd8d6d75d. The Straight flush gets there! On the river
QQQ won't call much (he can't even beat a straight) but might
make a small crying call out of frustration that his top set
couldn't find a repeater.

DEAL 4:
Seat 1:  7h5s4h3s  Seat 2: AJ96     Seat 3: T8s86s
Seat 4:  T432      Seat 5: J6c5c2c  Seat 6: J873
Seat 7:  QdJTd5d   Seat 8: Th865h   Seat 9: KKsQsQ
Seat 10: AdK93d

Preflop comment: Seat 9 has the fantastic KKsQsQ and should be
looking to pile in bets and raises preflop. He has a live
King and a live Queen. The live King is the King of Diamonds
so it's possible this hand will be a battle between a flopped
set of Kings for Seat 9 against a diamond flush draw for Seat 10.
Unplayable hands: Seat 2 (AJ96) seat 5 (J652) seat 4 (T432)

Flop: 4s42s. A dope flop that makes a full house for Seat 4,
trip 4s with an open ended straight flush draw for Seat 1,
a King high flush draw (dead to the full house) and 2 better
full house outs for KKQQ and not much for anyone else.

Runout: 4s42s97s. The KKQQ misses the better full house, and
the open ended straight flush draw rivers a better full house, 44477.
This is why T432 is unplayable.. even when it gets the miracle flop
it can still get outdrawn. Bad luck for Seat 9 who had a really
good starting hand but didn't connect with that dope flop.

DEAL 5:
Seat 1:  Ad8d62d   Seat 2: AsTc7c4s Seat 3: 987h3h
Seat 4:  Q85s3s    Seat 5: AcJcJ4   Seat 6: Qc995c
Seat 7:  KT62      Seat 8: J954     Seat 9: Kc3c32
Seat 10: KsQsQ7

Preflop comment: Some nice hands here, nut flush chances in
Diamonds, Spades and Clubs. Seat 5 has a nice chance at a set of Jacks
or the Club flush. Seat 10 has a great looking holding (KsQsQ7)
but doesn't know that he's no chance of a set of Queens and his
King-high spades are beaten by Seat 2's Ace-high spades. Hands
that should fold here are Seat 4 (Q85s3s), Seat 7 (KT62),
Seat 8 (J954) and Seat 9 (Kc3c32). With all the info we can see,
we'd fold seat 10 also but don't blame him for taking a flop!

Flop: 6s42s. A flopped straight and straight-flush chance for Seat 4,
Ace high flush chance for Seat 2, King high (losing) flush chance for
Seat 10 and 2-pair 6622 for Seat 1.

Turn: Ah. Three-pair now for Seat 1, no change to the other hands.

River: Jh. The Straight holds for Seat 4.

DEAL 6:
Seat 1:  AcJcJ4    Seat 2: KQ7d3d   Seat 3: Ts85s3
Seat 4:  QhTh64    Seat 5: A8c6c6   Seat 6: AsKd8d6s
Seat 7:  QsTc9c3s  Seat 8: J952     Seat 9: Q8s7s2
Seat 10: Ah9h7h2

Preflop comment: Seat 7 has a nice double suited hand but is
crushed by Ace-flushes in both suits. Seat 6 has a very nice
"suited Ace and suited King" hand that can flop well. I think
these hands should fold: Seats 2,3,4,8,9. The other five holdings
all look playable. Seat 4's hand, QhTh64, is one of those Omaha
holdings that looks good but isn't coordinated enough, it's two
quite marginal Holdem hands, QhTh and 64, the other combinations
aren't working. Seeing all the cards as we can, we see that the
QT combination is duplicated by the better, more co-ordinated,
QT9 in Seat 7, and the two hearts are crushed by the Ah9h7h
that Seat 10 holds.

Flop: JTd5d
Top set for Seat 1, Queen-high flush chance and Open-Ended Straight Draw
for Seat 2, bottom two pair for Seat 3, King-high flush draw and
gutshot Broadway chance for Seat 6, QJT9 wrap for Seat 7,
top and bottom pair for Seat 8. Notice that Seat 3 and Seat 8's
two pair hands, T5 and J5 on the JT5 flop, are no chance against
Seat 1's top set JJJ.

Turn: 5c. This repeater should get the flush draws and straight draws
out of the way and gives those no-chance two pair hands, who have
now filled up, the chance to give all their chips to Seat 1. There
are now no fewer than three full houses; JJJ55, 555TT and 555JJ. Seat 8,
with 555JJ, is unwilling to put Seat 1 on a better full house
because he'd need both the remaining Jacks to win. Which he does.

River: 7c. Nothing changes on the final board of JT557. If those lower
full houses haven't given the JJJ55 overfull all their chips yet,
they will on the river betting.

DEAL 7:
Seat 1:  KJc6c5    Seat 2: QhT6h2   Seat 3: ATh9h5
Seat 4:  Kc665c    Seat 5: AdQdJ7   Seat 6: KQc8c2
Seat 7:  ATs4s4    Seat 8: 433s2s   Seat 9: JdJs9s3d
Seat 10: AK9d7d

Preflop comment: Mostly playable hands here, without anything
to get too excited about. Seat 8 with 4332 is too low in rank
and should fold. Seat 4 has a nice hand with the chance of making
a King-high flush, a set of sixes or a low straight with the 65.
I also like Seat 9's double-suited Jacks but sadly both of the
Jacks he needs are in other holdings.

Flop: QT7. This flop helps most of the holdings; Seat 1 has KQJT
open-ender, Seat 2 has top 2, Seat 5 Nutshot to Broadway
(needs a King) and top and bottom 2 pair QQ77, Seat 9 QJT9
open-ender and Seat 10 a Nutshot to Broadway (needs a Jack,
which unfortunately can't arrive, the four Jacks are in the holdings.

Turn: 8 of spades, making Seat 9 the currently best straight.
On the turnboard of QT78 his J9 is currently the nuts. There's
now a worse two pair QQ88 for Seat 6.

River: offsuit 9, bringing in Seat 1's open-ender. On the final board
of QT789, Seat 1's KJ has the nut straight and has bad-beated Seat 9.
Seat 9 is likely to pay off a bet here, because with two Jacks in his
own holding he might reason that his Jacks are blockers and Seat
1 probably doesn't have the exact hand King-Jack needed to make
the nuts. Sadly for Seat 9, Seat 1 indeed has the nuts.

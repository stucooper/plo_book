DO YOUR OWN BETTING

Last updated: 20200327

In No Limit Holdem, you need to slowplay and trap your opponents.
There's often just two or three players still active on the flop,
and if you bet your big hands too big you risk everyone
folding and winning a small pot. You want to bet to
build a bigger pot so you can win big with your big hand,
but if you bet too big too soon you might lose your customers.
So slowplay and trapping are a key part of No Limit Holdem.

In No Limit Holdem, post-flop bets are often sixty to eighty percent
of the pot. In Pot Limit Omaha the most you can bet is
the size of the pot (100%) and the bet is often exactly that size.
So a $2/$3 NLH cash hand might have a raise to $10, a bunch of folds,
the big blind call and a pot of $22. On the flop of K86 two diamonds,
the preflop bettor bets $15 and the caller folds and we move onto the
next hand. In a $1/3 Omaha cash hand, someone limps then the next player
raises to $13 and there are three callers, including both blinds. The
flop comes K86, two diamonds, the preflop bettor bets the full pot of
$52 and one player drops out but two players call. In the Holdem hand
the winner has a pot of $22 and we didn't get to see the turn, in the
Omaha hand there's still three players hotly contesting a pot that's
now $156.

Pot Limit Omaha is not the trapping game that No Limit Holdem is.
There's three key reasons for this.

1) There's often three or more players still active on the flop.
   More players means more chance that someone's also connected
   well with the flop, and will call your big bets and give you action.

2) Each player has four cards not two cards. Players can have a primary
   draw with a backup draw. If the board pairs, it's possible for a
   player who was staying in with a different draw to make a full house
   using other cards in his holding.

3) The betting is Pot Limit, so you can't blast players out of the pot
   on the flop with an oversized bet. The worst immediate odds a player
   is getting, facing a single pot bet, is 2 to 1. If the pot is $70 and
   you bet the pot of $70, the first player is being presented with a
   call of $70 into a pot of $140, 2 to 1. Of course is a second player
   raises, other players in this pot aren't getting 2 to 1, they're
   getting much worse odds.

Computer people, especially those who work in accounting, will
know the popular accounting software MYOB (Mind Your Own Business).
Do Your Own Betting is such a crucial aspect of Omaha it
gets its own shorthand acronym: DYOB. Do Your Own Betting.
Don't wait or hope for someone else to bet for you, do it yourself.

Like any poker advice you sometimes vary from this approach,
but normally your best course of action is to bet your big hands
and bet them big. Protect your big hands. You'll win bigger pots
when your opponents call with their worse hands or their draws and they
miss. If everyone folds to your bet, that's still a good result, you
might have got a bad two pair hand to fold that would have made a
long-odds full house on the turn. Winning huge pots is fantastic, winning
small pots is great, losing small pots is OK, losing huge pots is a
disaster. If you don't DYOB, you set yourself up for losing huge pots.

One of the worst plays in Omaha is checking the flop when you should
have bet, betting the turn which has now made it attractive for
a player to call, or even put him in the lead and then losing a big pot
on the river. Had you simply bet the flop, you would've picked up the
pot then and there. Your slowplay has trapped nobody but yourself.
That's exactly the pattern I'll show you in the following
Badly Played Hand

Badly played hand: August 2018, The Star 1/3 PLO
================================================

I'm in the hijack seat with A982, with the A2 both being clubs.
It's bet to $10, a few of us call, the button raises to $35 and
there's five callers to a flop of $165. Everyone has $200-$500 stacks.

I'm 4th of 5 to act postflop, giving me great absolute position
and great relative position to the preflop bettor. The flop comes
A83, giving me top two pair. Three players check to me and I also
check, thinking I'll check-raise all-in after the button bets. This
plan doesn't work, because the button checks too and all five
players are alive to the turn. The turn comes a Queen.

There's three more checks to me and now I think it's time to
come out betting and I bet $160. The button quickly folds and
so do two other players but after a long, long think, the player
to my right calls the $160, leaving him about $85 behind. Heads up
to the river which is a 9.

I've now improved slightly to a better two pair, AA99, but on this
final board of A83Q9, First to Act is all in for $87. I call and
he shows his holding is JT96 and he's made the nut straight,
QJT98.

By not betting on the flop, I keep JT96 in the hand. If he'd faced
a bet of $160 on the flop of A83, he'd have folded JT96 in a heartbeat
because he's only got runner-runner straight outs. But when the
turn came the Q, on the turn he's got a QJT98 9-out inside wrap; plus
a King will give him Broadway with his JT. I think that's why he
took so long on the call; he might have folded with the inside wrap
but when he realised the King was another nut out for him his 9-out
draw became a 13 out draw, all of them nut. He might still be just
under the 33% chance expressed chance he needs even with a 13-out
draw but I can't blame him for calling on the turn. The only
person I can blame in this hand is myself. I didn't Do My Own Betting.

What card was I hoping for on the turn? If the A or 8 pairs, I get no
action with my top full house, if the 3 pairs I'm possibly losing
to bottom trips and might pay off a bet with a lousy 4-out full
house draw and if some other card comes, it could look
safe but it's actually made someone else's hand have a zillion outs going
to the river. That's exactly what happened in this case.

One major problem in my thinking during this hand was hoping that
the Button would bet this flop for me. The button probably had a
hand like KKQT and is in no way excited by a nothing flop of A83.
When you're 4th out of 5 to act, your chances for check-raising
are very bad after three checks in front of you. Simply Do Your
Own Betting.

If I'd DYOB here, I'd have picked up a good $165 pot instead
of losing another $235. DYOB!!

Jamming with Top Set
====================

It's a tradition in PLO to Jam when you flop Top Set. Charge the other
players for their draws and start building the pot. If the board pairs
on the turn you might not get any further action so at least you've
picked up some more money with the calls on the flop betting.

Sometimes middle set or top two pair will raise your flop bet. This is
a fantastic result as you can get your stack in against a player who
might only have one out; the card that makes his middle set quads. A
player with top two pair against your top set may have just runner-runner
quads out only.

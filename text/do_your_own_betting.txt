DO YOUR OWN BETTING

Last updated: 20180825

In No Limit Holdem, you need to slowplay and trap your opponents.
There's sometimes only two or three players still active on the flop,
and if you bet your big hands too big on the flop you risk everyone
folding and winning a small pot.

Pot Limit Omaha is not the trapping game that No Limit Holdem is.
There's three important reasons for this.

1) There's normally more than three players still active on the flop.
   More players means there's more chance that someone's also connected
   well with the flop, and will call your big bets and give you action.

2) Each player has four cards not two cards. Players can have a primary
   draw with a backup draw. If the board pairs, it's very easy for a
   player who was staying in with a different draw to make a full house
   using other cards in his holding.

3) As the betting is Pot Limit, you can't blast players out of the pot
   on the flop with an oversized bet. The worst immediate odds a player
   is getting,facing a single pot bet is 2 to 1. If the pot is $70 and
   you bet the pot of $70, the first player is being presented with a
   call of $70 into a pot of $140, 2 to 1. Of course is a second player
   raises, other players in this pot aren't getting 2 to 1, they're
   getting worse odds.

Computer people, especially those who've worked in accounting, will
know the popular accounting software MYOB (Mind Your Own Business).
Do Your Own Betting is such a crucial aspect of Omaha it
gets its own shorthand acronym: DYOB. Do Your Own Betting.
Don't wait or expect someone else to bet for you, do it yourself.

Like a lot of poker advice you can sometimes vary from this approach,
but normally your best course of action is to bet your big hands
and bet them big. Protect your big hands. You'll win bigger pots
when your opponents call with their worse hands or their draws and they
miss. If everyone folds to your bet, that's still a good result, you
might have got a bad two pair hand to fold that would have made a
long-odds full house on the turn. Winning huge pots is fantastic, winning
small pots is great, losing small pots is OK, losing huge pots is a
disaster. If you don't DYOB, you set yourself up for losing huge pots.

One of the worst plays in Omaha is checking the flop when you should
have bet, betting the turn which has now made it attractive for
a player to call and then losing a big pot on the river. Had you
simply bet the flop, you would've picked up the pot then and there.
That's exactly the pattern I'll show you in the following
Badly Played Hand

Badly played hand: August 2018, Star City 1/3 PLO
=================================================

I'm in the hijack seat with A982, with the A2 both being clubs.
It's bet to $10, a few of us call, the button raises to $35 and
there's five callers to a flop of $165. Everyone has $200-$500 stacks.

I'm 4th of 5 to act postflop, giving me great absolute position
and great relative position to the preflop bettor. The flop comes
A83, giving me top two pair. Three players check to me and I also
check, thinking I'll check-raise all-in after the button bets. This
plan doesn't work, because the button checks too and all five
players are alive to the turn. The turn comes a Queen.

There's three more checks to me and now I think it's time to
come out betting and I bet $160. The button quickly folds and
so do two other players but after a long, long think, the player
to my right calls the $160, leaving him about $85 behind. Heads up
to the river which is a 9.

I've now improved slightly to a better two pair, AA99, but on this
final board of A83Q9, First to Act is all in for $87. I call and
he shows his holding is JT96 and he's made the nut straight,
QJT98.

By not betting on the flop, I keep JT96 in the hand. If he'd faced
a bet of $160 on the flop of A83, he'd have folded JT96 in a heartbeat
because he's only got runner-runner straight outs. But when the
turn came the Q, on the turn he's got a QJT98 9-out inside wrap; plus
a King will give him Broadway with his JT. I think that's why he
took so long on the call; he might have folded with the inside wrap
but when he realised the King was another nut out for him his 9-out
draw became a 13 out draw, all of them nut. He might still be just
under the 33% chance expressed chance he needs even with a 13-out
draw but I can't blame him for calling on the turn. The only
person I can blame in this hand is myself. I didn't Do My Own Betting.

What card was I hoping for on the turn? If the A or 8 pairs, I get no
action with my top full house, if the 3 pairs I'm possibly losing
to bottom trips and might pay off a bet with a lousy 4-out full
house draw and if the some other card comes, it might look
innocuous but might make someone else's hand have a zillion outs going
to the river. That's exactly what happened in this case.

One major problem in my thinking during this hand was hoping that
the Button would bet this flop for me. The button probably had a
hand like KKQT and is in no way excited by a nothing flop of A83.
When you're 4th out of 5 to act, your chances for check-raising
are very bad after three checks in front of you. Simply Do Your
Own Betting.

THE PREFLOP BETTING ROUND

Last Updated: 20180816

There's a few common ways the betting goes preflop in
most PLO hands. I'll mention four types, which I'll call
Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 and Type 4. And I'll start with
something you'll almost never see, type 0, the no-action
preflop Round.

TYPE 0: A walk for the Big Blind

Every single player including the Small Blind folds preflop.
The Big Blind wins a pot of $4 (his own $3 plus the Small Blind's
$1). No rake is taken. This scenario occurs 0% of the time. I might
have seen it twice in my life. This is called a "Walk" for the
Big Blind, a term borrowed from Baseball. If four pitches are
outside the strike zone, a batter gets to walk to first base
with no effort on his part.

Walks happen most often when shorthanded in tournaments.
The blinds are huge, nobody wakes up with a good hand, even
the small blind has junk and won't complete the bet. This book
is about PLO Cash and you almost never see a walk in PLO cash.

TYPE 1: Limpers and folders

Everyone either limps for $3 or folds. 6, 7 or even 8
runners take the flop, and the pot size is $18-$24.
Now and then you get the family pot of 10 limpers, $30 pot.

TYPE 2: Single raise, bunch of callers

An early position player raises pot to $10 (or $13, $15, $16 depending
on how many limpers there are before him) and there's a few folds
but still a bunch of callers. 4 to 7 runners take the flop and
the pot size is $40-$100.

TYPE 3: Raise and reraise and some callers

There's a bet of $10 but a reraise to $40, a few callers and it's back
to the original $10 raiser, who could now re-raise pot to $160 or $200
but in the end just calls the reraise to $40. 4 or 5 runners take the
flop and the pot size is $160-$200.

TYPE 4: Rereraise, the four-bet pot

This situation is like TYPE 3, but the original $10 raiser does choose
to re-re-raise, and instead of calling for $40 he makes it $150-$200 to go.
The $40 flat callers all fold (though if one is a shortstack of $100 he
might undercall and take his chances, making a main pot of $340 but a side
pot of $250 or so).

You might know already that a raise is a "2-bet" a re-raise a "3-bet"
and the next raise a "4-bet" and so on. I've numbered my types the
same way, Type 1 is everyone calling the Big Blind of $3, Type 2 is
a 2-bet pot to $10, Type 3 a 3-bet pot to $40 and Type 4 4-bet to $120
or more. Just like in No Limit Texas, the hole cards should be getting
stronger and stronger the more the preflop betting escalates.

Go to YouTube and look up "Vanessa Selbst Prahlad Friedman" and you'll
see a disastrous 6-bet bluff by Selbst with J7 of diamonds in a cash
game where she's up against Prahlad Friedman who has both red Aces!
The pot is $1200 (6 runners, ante $100 and small blind/big blind
of $300/$600).

Selbst puts in the first raise to $1,300 and then the betting
between her and Friedman follows:

Selbst             Friedman
        Antes + Blinds: 1,200
1,300    (2-bet)
                   4,000   (3-bet)
13,200   (4-bet, a pot sized raise: 3x4,000+1,2000)
                   35,000  (5-bet)
106,200  (6-bet, again a pot sized raise: 3x35,000+1,200)
                  179,600  (7-bet all in)
169,500  (undercall all in)

The commentators expect Selbst will fold when confronted with the call
to 35,000; the 6-bet to 106,200 is her huge mistake in the hand.

The pot is $340,200 and Selbst and Friedman agree to run the board
three times. Friedman wins all three of them.

There's a huge difference between Type 3 and Type 4 hands. Try to have
a good sense of whether the $10 raiser will come right over the top.
Have a good sense of just how much you'll have to pay to see the flop.
If you're not confident you can see the flop at a price right for you
and your holding, fold as cheaply as you can.

A $100 shortstack knows (just like a shortstack in Tournament NLH)
that his best chance of winning is to beat a single hand heads-up.
In the PLO preflop betting round, a $100 shortstack will often minraise
again from $40 to $70, giving the main re-raiser a chance to come
right over the top and giving the shortstack the easiest of $30
calls and the chance to double-up-and-a-bit by beating just one hand.
A $100 stack will sometimes just call the $40, but a nuisance raise
or an all-in can be a better play, from her perspective. That's part
of The Shortstack Advantage.

Put a value on your hand, and adjust your thinking as the betting changes
and new information comes in.
Absolute trash can be folded as it isn't even worth $3. Most $3 calling
hands are worth $10 (though if you're in the small blind for just $1 you
can normally fold, saving yourself a nice $9 and remember you're in
shocking position for the rest of the hand). If the $10 gets raised to $40
you now need to consider if it'll still get raised. The worst thing
to happen is you call the $40, not closing the betting, and it
still gets raised again. You're now faced with the Hobson's choice
of folding (wasting that $40 call and not even seeing the flop) or
calling off another $100+ when you could be way behind and you're just
hoping to catch lucky. Poker is about avoiding the tough decisions
and you've just landed in the middle of a tough decision where both
outcomes look bad.

There's another kind of preflop betting round, unique to
Omaha, which I call Step Raising. It's so important that I've
written a whole chapter on it. Breifly, it's when two guys keep
min-raising when the action comes to them, and all the callers in
the middle get sandwiched. It's an important concept to understand
(that's why it gets its own full chapter). A sixth kind of
preflop betting round, also getting its own chapter, is the Party Hands
Preflop Betting Round, where 4 or 5 players each get their stacks
all-in preflop. Should you join the party?

There's a few variations on the dollar amounts that don't change my
advice substantially. Sometimes the 3-bet is from $10 to $25 and there's
six runners to a flop of $150. Sometimes there's 3 runners in a 4-bet pot
of $210.

You need a fair bit of table time and experience to get good at this.
Your ideas about what hands to play and fold might be very different
to mine. That's great - use the book as a starting point and adjust
to your style and play the game you're comfortable with. Think about
my Type 1,2,3,4 hands and see which hands you'd play in each
circumstance.

TYPE 1: Play all non-trash hands. You can fold 44, 33, 22 hands if
        you like, as they flop bottom set way too often and can
        cost you your stack. They can't cost you your stack if you
	don't take a flop with them in the first place.
TYPE 2: Fold one-way hands where the only thing going is a pocket pair
        in the 99,88,77,66,55,44,33,22 range
TYPE 3: Fold hands with a dangler: KQJ4, TT95. Fold weirdo straight hands
        that need too much help from the flop: hands like J975 and T865
        where you need two perfect cards on the flop and any two-pair
        hits will be losers.
TYPE 4: Fold one-way nut-flush holdings. Look for Aces crackers. Fold
        hands containing an Ace: you expect you're up against AA so
        the Ace in your holding counts against you. Fold Badugi
        holdings. Fold one-way high pair holdings: KK,QQ,JJ. You'll
        often play TT as you'll usually have good backup straight
        cards to it. Consider playing double-paired holdings and
        double suited holdings.

In Type 3 pots, Nuttability is more important than Floppability.
There's probably still 3 or 4 runners in this pot and you'll have
to showdown a Nut or Near-Nut hand to win. In a Type 4 pot
Floppability is king. A Type 4 pot will often be just you against
Aces and you can win with a weaker showndown hand like Two Pair.
Smaller straights and flushes can also be good enough to win,
in this heads-up situation.

When you get in a Type 4 pot, you won't have many chips left to
bet on the flop, turn or river. Unless you get a disaster flop like
J55 or 773 or AKT you're probably going to commit the rest of your chips.
So a flat call preflop into a big Type 4 pot can save you a bit of money
when the flop is horrible; while you still figure to get paid off when
you hit. Saving a bit here and there isn't a priority in Omaha
where the pots get huge in the blink of an eye but I still think
it's worthwhile keeping some chips when you've taken a flop
but the flop tells you that you just can't win. You're in a big
pot with T986 all red and the flop is A44 all black.
What can you beat? What hand can you possibly make in the runout?

You want a hand that a lot of flops will hit hard; which is why you
have to fold those KK,QQ,JJ one-way holdings: when they flop well
they're winners but there's not a lot of flops that hit them hard.
You don't want to be on the wrong side of an AA v KK all-in matchup,
you'd remember from Holdem that AA wins 80% of the time. In Omaha
your good side cards and extra ways to win should put you about a
40% chance to win, twice the chance of your Holdem matchup.

Since you expect
you're up against Aces, it's better to have straight rundowns than
a pair in your own holding. You normally crack Aces by making two
pair, a straight or a flush, not as often by making trips to a
pair in your holding. You also don't want an Ace in your holding,
because that takes away your chances of making two pair and
means you have fewer straight cards working for you.

QJT9 is better against AA than QQJT. JT98 is even better because with
QJT9 you're unlikely to get AK on the board since two of the Aces are
out already.

A one gapped straight, QJT8, is better than JT99. Why? With QJT8, a
9 on the flop will usually flop you a big straight wrap which will
get there a lot of the time. And there's 4 unknown 9s to come on the flop.
But with JT99 there's only 2 unknown 9s to come on the flop and make you
trips.

The Type 3 to Type 4 Decision
=============================

It's vitally important that you play the Type 3 and Type 4 pots soundly.

When you're considering calling into a Type 4 pot preflop and the
decision is pretty marginal, add or subtract value to your holding
based on these ideas:

Add credit for 2 flush cards
Remove credit if all 4 cards are the same suit
Add credit for double suited
Remove credit for a Badugi holding

Your holding shouldn't have danglers, you should have folded danglers
when the preflop betting went from Type 2 to Type 3.

Straightedness counts for more than suitedness when trying to crack Aces,
but suitedness is your main backup for those times when your straight
chance doesn't flop. So you can use the presence or absence of suits
in your own holding as a tie-breaker when you've got a close 50-50 fold
or call decision.

Some Omaha advice advocates reraising yourself when you've got an
Aces-cracking hand with great Floppability. I don't normally play
this way but the idea interests me. I've lost a lot of Type 3
pots when I've beaten the Aces easily enough but come second to a player
who I could've got out preflop had I reraised it to Type 4. Still, I've
saved a lot of money by keeping pots at Type 3 where possible, and saving
money when I've missed the flop. Any Omaha hand, no matter how good its
Floppability, can miss a flop.

There's Risk/Reward in any poker action. This is like calling a
bet with 66 in Holdem and there's three to the flop which is T63.
A lot of money goes in and you get rivered by 54 suited when his
straight gets there, the other hand, the original preflop raiser
had KK. If you'd reraised the KK preflop you'd have got 54 out preflop
and doubled up. But if you keep reraising bets preflop in Holdem with
66 against higher pairs you'll go broke very quickly indeed.

If you keep the pot at Type 3, you'll save money when you whiff
but sometimes you'll cost yourself a pot which you would've
won had you made it Type 4 preflop.

Watch your holding card by card
===============================

If you like, peek at your hole cards one-by-one as they arrive
during the deal. You'll see if your hand is getting better or getting worse.
If your hand converges to good straight cards, or a high pair with flush
chances it's worth playing. If your hand has diverged and is all over
the place, it is trash and can be folded.

Say your first two cards are AhJc. That's two good hole cards, and the
next hole card would be great if it was another heart (making you nut
flush chances in hearts), another Ace, another Jack or another Broadway
card. If however your first 2 cards are 83 or K5 there's not going
to be a 3rd card which you like very often, in fact you could almost
fold your hand now and not be making too big a mistake. You might end
up with KQJ5 or 8763 but right now your hand sucks. And actually
KQJ5 and 8763 suck too.

Now and then your first 2 cards will be good and your holding
will get worse as the next cards arrive. Remember 3 or 4 flush cards
isn't as good as 2 flush cards, and three of a kind in your own holding
is trash.

SPR: Stack to Pot Ratio
=======================

You may know the concept of SPR: Stack to Pot Ratio.
It's a measure of how big the current pot is, compared to the size
of the remaining stacks. The bigger the pot, the more chances you'll
take to win it, the bigger the stacks, the more careful you'll have
to be.

If you're left with fewer chips than the current pot, your only
move is to bet all-in, or call all-in, or fold. You're getting
better than 2 to 1 on your call so you should call with most of
your draws and your 2 pair hands and single pair/3 overcard hands.
There's not a lot of Poker left to be played in this hand; unless
you whiff the flop you'll be committing your stack.

You might not want to commit right now though. If you're on a draw,
try to see the turn and river for free and you retain at least some
bluffing power if the river doesn't complete your draw but still
looks scary. If you'd got all in on the flop you'd get called by an overpair
or two pair hand that would fold when the board runs out four to a straight.

If you've got a marginal made hand like two pair, go all-in now. Your
opponent might be on a draw and you've got to charge him to draw out.
He won't commit while he's still on the draw and he might not pay
you off on the river if he misses. So get his chips in the pot while
you're ahead and he's still got drawing hope.

NUTSHOTTING

Last updated: 20181005

Everyone knows that a gutshot straight draw is a thin draw
with just 4 outs, and unless you're getting a ridiculous
10 to 1 on your call, you're going well against the odds.

I'll sometimes take this longshot call in Omaha on the flop.
Because the betting is Pot Limit, the flop bet isn't too
large and if I hit my magic out I'll be able to win loads more
money. If I put in a big bet on the turn with a made
straight and I get called by two pair hands or flush draws
with just one card to come, the callers are the people
making the mistakes.

I call this "Nutshotting"- taking a gutshot draw to a
Nut Straight. Other poker writers have come up with
the word "Nutshot" as well.

To call with a Nutshot Draw, I want as many of the following conditions
to be true as possible:

1) My draw is to the Nuts, or if it hits I'm confident beyond
   argument that my hand is the winner
2) If I hit my draw on the turn, I have a redraw to an even nuttier hand.
3) I have enough chips behind that if my draw hits on the turn I can
   put in a huge bet to charge any sets and flush draws and two pair hands
   the maximum to try and outdraw me (and hopefully miss)
4) I have good reason to believe that if I hit, the whole pot will be mine.
   I won't be splitting this pot with the same straight.
5) There's no board pair on the flop, and the flop isn't onesuit. Don't
   draw to straights when higher rung hands are already possible
6) There's some other passengers in this pot, and if I call on the flop
   there will be a cascade of callers behind me, adding value when I hit
   and allowing me to put in an even bigger turn bet if I hit. Since
   there's still me and three or more other players in the pot, if I
   hit the nutshot on the turn and bet the pot, there's a good chance
   this big bet will be called by at least two players.
7) My hand's got a bit more value then just the nutshot. I might
   already have a pair that could luckboat by the river, or a pocket
   pair that could spike a set. Runner-runner flush chances also
   count as a tiny bit more value.
8) I won't get re-raised by a later actor. Either I'm last to call and
   my call closes the betting, or my best judgement is that everyone
   else will flat call or fold, as I hope for in condition (6).

Here's an example of two Nutshot draws I took, from my session notes
of 2nd March 2018. In the first hand I have Q776, four players have
paid $10 to take the flop which comes Q53 two spades. I don't have
spades myself, I've missed my 777 set and my top pair, while
adding a bit of value to my hand, isn't going to be an unimproved winner.

There's a $40 pot bet behind my check, and two callers when action returns
to me. I'm a bit leery of the spades, but most of my Nutshot conditions
are present. My draw is to the Nuts. If I spike the 4, I should be the
only player with the 76 straight (I have two Sevens in my own holding).
I've got $190 left which I can blast all in with on the turn. With three
players along for the ride I should get paid off if I hit. Also my call
here closes off the betting so I make the call and I'm happy I did when
the turn comes a black Four, but it's Clubs not Spades. My $190
jam is called by two players, one with the flush draw and the other with
a lower flush draw and the beaten A2345 wheel straight. The river is a red
Eight and I pull in a big pot.

I've made a lot more than 10 to 1 on that $40 flop call. I won
the $160 that the pot was when I was calling into it
(only $10 of which was mine from the preflop action) and
another $380 on top of that from the two callers on the turn.
I called $40 and won $530, on a 10 to 1 shot.

If I'd had more money behind to bet on the river I would have got
a crying call from the low straight, though not the missed flush draw.

In my second Nutshot draw, I'm playing the co-ordinated but low
holding of 6432. The flop comes AJ5. Normally these 9-out
"pair one of your three cards" straight draws aren't as good as they
look, but here my 6 gives me redraws to higher straights if I can spike
a 2, 3 or 4 on the turn. Because Ace wraps high and low for straights,
I'm going to get out of this pot if the turn card is a K,Q or T as
I could be drawing dead against a made Broadway.

I make a Nutshot call on the flop and the turn comes a repeat Jack,
making the turnboard of AJ5J. I get out of the way as the two other
players get their stacks in.

AJxy crushes J5xy. This is a cooler for J5, who has just learned a valuable
lesson in what happens when you flop bottom two pair in Omaha.

Don't nutshot to Broadway
-------------------------

I almost never nutshot to Broadway. A lot of people (correctly)
play hands with Broadway cards in them so there's likely to
be fewer than 4 outs for my draw, the cards that I need are
mostly in people's holdings already. What's already a thin
draw is wafer-thin here. Also, it's quite likely that if my
Broadway draw does come in, I'll split the pot with someone
or be freerolled as they have Broadway with two-pair or
Broadway with a flush draw.

Most of my nutshots are with connectors in the midrange rank;
6,7,8,9,T.

You don't have to play like this
--------------------------------

You might prefer not to add nutshotting to your game and that's
fine. Nutshotting is a long-odds shot, and you could argue
quite forcibly that my nutshot draws are going well against
the odds. A lot of the time I get my nutshot on the turn and
lose a huge pot when the river brings the third flush card
or pairs the board. Nutshotting might not be a winner in
a risk/reward sense. I thought long and hard about leaving
this chapter out of my book, but I have to be true to myself
and my readers and be honest about how I play, and nutshotting
is part of my game.

There's not as much bluffing in Omaha as there is in Holdem,
you normally have to make a strong poker hand (often the nuts)
and show it down to win a pot. Paying for a Nutshot draw is
an attempt to make a winning hand, even against the odds.
You don't have to nutshot as often as I do, and you can
run through my list of Nutshotting conditions to decide
when to nutshot and when not to nutshot, but it should
be some part of your game.

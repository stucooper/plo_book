NUTSHOTTING

Last updated: 20180816

Everyone knows that a gutshot straight draw is a thin draw
with just 4 outs, and unless you're getting a ridiculous
10 to 1 on your call, you're going well against the odds.

I'll sometimes take this longshot call in PLO facing a flop bet.
Because the betting is Pot Limit, the flop bet often isn't too
large and if I hit my magic out I'll be able to win tons more
money. I call this "Nutshotting"- taking a gutshot draw to a
Nut Straight.

To call with a Nutshot Draw, I want as many of these conditions
to be true

1) My draw is to the Nuts, or if it hits I'm confident beyond
   argument that my hand is the winner
2) If I hit my draw on the turn, I have a redraw to an even nuttier hand.
3) I have enough chips behind that if my draw hits on the turn I can
   put in a huge bet to charge any sets and flush draws and two pair hands
   the maximum to try and outdraw me (and hopefully miss)
4) I have good reason to believe that if I hit, the whole pot will be mine.
   I shouldn't be splitting this pot with the same straight.
5) There's no board pair on the flop, and the flop isn't onesuit. Don't
   draw to straights when higher rung hands are already possible
6) There's some other passengers in this pot, and if I call on the flop
   there will be a cascade of callers behind me, adding value when I hit
   and allowing me to put in an even bigger turn bet if I hit.
7) My hand's got a tiny bit more value then just the nutshot. I might
   already have a pair that could luckboat by the river, or a pocket
   pair that could spike a set. Runner-runner flush chances also
   qualifies here.

Here's an example of two Nutshot draws I took, from my session notes
of 2nd March 2018. In the first hand I have Q776, four players have
paid $10 to take the flop which comes Q53 two spades. I don't have
spades myself, I've missed my 777 set and my top pair, while
adding a bit of value to my hand, isn't going to be an unimproved winner.

There's a $40 pot bet behind my check, and two callers when action returns
to me. I'm a bit leery of the spades, but most of my Nutshot conditions
are present. My draw is to the Nuts. If I spike the 4, I should be the
only player with the 76 straight (I have two Sevens in my own holding).
I've got $189 left which I can blast all in with on the turn. With three
players along for the ride I should get paid off if I hit. Also my call
here closes off the betting so I make the call and I'm happy I did when
the turn comes a black Four, but it's Clubs not Spades. My $189
jam is called by two players, one with the flush draw and the other with
a lower flush draw and the beaten A2345 wheel straight. The river is a red
Eight and I pull in a big pot.

In my second Nutshot draw, I'm playing the co-ordinated by low
holding of 6432. The flop comes AJ5. Normally these 9-out
"pair one of your three cards" straight draws aren't as good as they
look, but here my 6 gives me redraws to higher straights if I can spike
a 2, 3 or 4 on the turn. Again I make a Nutshot call on the flop and
here the turn is a repeat Jack, giving us the turnboard of AJ5J. I
get out of the way as two player get their stacks in with AJxy crushing
J5xy. This is a cooler for J5, I'll have more to say about this same
hand in my section on two-pair hands.

A PROFESSIONAL OUTLOOK

"Poker is like sex: everyone thinks they are the best at it
 but few actually know what they are doing" - Layne Flack.

Treat poker seriously. 

The amateur twice-a-month player can just play poker now and then and not
devote hours of time into improving his game. He plays poker recreationally;
the way that many of us do our sports betting or horserace betting.

The cash poker player who plays twice-a-week or more needs to treat
the game with seriousness and respect.

The Make-a-List Foundation
==========================

You're heard of the Make A Wish Foundation, a charity that helps
very sick kids forget their troubles for even just one day.
I'd like to welcome you to the Make-a-List Foundation. Make-a-List
helps poker players remember their poker; and to think about aspects
of poker by writing lists about it. At various times during the book
I'll be asking you to stop reading for a few minutes and make a
list. You'll need some spare notepaper, a lined A4 notepad works
best for me but any pen and paper will do.

Make-a-List Task: List 5 reasons why you play Casino Cash Poker

Here I'd like you to write 5 reasons, in any order of importance.
Write two or three sentences per reason. Why do you play poker,
and why do you play it at the casino? Do you play poker online
or pub tournaments? Why cash poker?

You probably wrote "To make money" as your first reason and
struggled to think of four more. That's OK, there's no
pass or fail in this list writing exercise. The point about
writing these lists is to get you thinking about poker
and get you thinking about your own game.

Here's my list of 5 reasons I play cash poker at the casino

1) It's cash, so I win and lose real money right from the start.
   If I double up in a tournament early on I haven't won any money
   yet and while I'm in a good early chip position I'm not much closer
   to the money.

2) The casino is an exciting place to be. It's a different, more
   glamorous world than either my home world, office world or social world.

3) Poker is a gambling game I can have an advantage in. If I'm better
   than the other players and get my fair share of card luck, I should
   win good money.

4) I win or lose due to my own decisions at the table. It's just me
   there at the table. 

5) I can play whenever I want to. I come and go as I please, a few times
   each week.


Self Awareness
==============

The more you understand yourself, and the more honest you are with yourself,
the better poker player you'll be. Deception and Bluffing are part of poker
at the table, but you've got to be honest with yourself. You need to be
self-aware. Poker is full of people who think they're a lot better at the
game than they really are. Don't be one of these people. Be humble and
realise that there's plenty you have to learn about the game.

Poker is a very difficult game. There's people who are good enough and
work hard at it and do it for a living. There's very few people who
make a living at Blackjack or Roulette or games where the house
has the edge. Poker is advantage gambling. Your study and hard work
and concentration is your advantage.

The fact Poker is such a hard game is good. If the game were a lot easier,
then most player would play to a high level and the game would just be
card luck and everyone would win or lose a bit and the rake would eat
everyone up. But poker's a hard game and there are bad players, who
aren't working on their game and aren't changing their lazy bad poker habits.
This is a huge advantage for the better players who can recognize
and exploit the flaws of the bad players.

A Poker Professional
====================

You don't have to play for a living to treat poker professionally. As a
regular player you should be treating the game seriously. You can
still enjoy the game, in fact the better you play the game the
more you'll enjoy it and the more satisfaction you'll get from poker.

A PROFESSIONAL OUTLOOK

"Poker is like sex: everyone thinks they are the best at it
 but few actually know what they are doing" - Layne Flack.

Treat poker seriously. 

The amateur twice-a-month player can just play poker now and then and not
spend hours of time improving his game. He plays poker recreationally;
the way that many of us do sports betting or horserace betting.

The cash poker player who plays at least twice-a-week needs to treat
the game with seriousness and respect.

The Make-a-List Foundation
==========================

You're heard of the Make A Wish Foundation, a charity that helps
very sick kids forget their troubles for even just one day.
In this book you're part of the Make-a-List Foundation. Make-a-List
helps poker players think about their poker: think about aspects
of poker by writing lists about it. At various times during the book
I'll be asking you to stop reading for a few minutes and make a
list. You'll need some spare notepaper, a lined A4 notepad works
best for me but any pen and paper will do.

Make-a-List Task: List 5 reasons, in any order of importance,
why you play Casino Cash Poker.

Expand on each reason with 2 or 3 sentences. Why do you play poker,
and why do you play it at the casino? Do you also play poker online
and pub tournaments? Home games? How do you find cash compared
to tournaments? Do you do any other gambling? How do you find
poker compared to other gambling?

That ">>>" prompt above is my indication that it's time for you
to stop and make a list. It's like what a computer
program might print to tell you it's time for you to provide some
input and then hit the "Enter" key to continue.

You probably wrote "To make money" as your first reason and
struggled to think of four more. That's OK, there's no
pass or fail in this list writing exercise. The point about
writing these lists is to get you thinking about poker
and get you thinking about your own game.

Here's my list of 5 reasons I play cash poker at the casino

1) It's cash, so I win and lose real money right from the start.
   If I double up in a tournament early on I haven't won any money
   yet and while I'm in a good early chip position I'm not much closer
   to the money. In cash, I'm already at the Final Table and I'm
   winning or losing actual dollars right now.

2) The casino is an exciting place to be. It's a different, more
   glamorous world than either my home world, office world or social world.

3) Poker is a gambling game I can have an advantage in. If I'm better
   than the other players and get my fair share of card luck, I should
   win good money.

4) I win or lose due to my own decisions at the table. I can't control
   the card luck, but my folds, calls, bets and raises are my own
   decisions and responsibility. In Sports Bets and Horse Racing bets,
   I'm at the mercy of luck after I've placed my bet.

5) I can play whenever I want to. I come and go as I please, a few times
   each week. I don't have to commit to a regular weekly tournament, I
   fit my poker sessions around my other commitments.


Self Awareness
==============

The more you understand yourself, the more honest you are with yourself,
the better poker player you'll be. Deception and Bluffing are part of poker
at the table, but trick the other players, don't bluff yourself.

You need to be self-aware. Poker and gambling are full of people who think
they're a lot better at the game than they actually are, as Layne
Flack says at the start of this chapter. Don't be one of these people.
Be humble and realise that there's plenty you have to learn
about the game.

I've seen a lot of interviews with big tournament winners like
Phil Hellmuth saying words like "Poker's been good to me, I've
been so lucky, I'm blessed" and I used to think it was affected
modesty but I now think that's what self-aware players believe.
They know their edge in poker is small and they're genuinely
grateful for the card luck they've had to win a tournament.

Poker is a very difficult game. There's people who are good enough and
work hard at it and do it for a living. There's very few people who
make a living at Blackjack or Roulette or games where the House
has the edge. Plus if they can beat the game, the casino can
ban them, which they won't do at Poker where you're winning money
from the other players and not the House. Poker is advantage gambling.
Your study, hard work, patience and concentration is your advantage.

The fact Poker is such a hard game is good. If the game were easier,
more player would play to a high level and the game would just be
card luck and everyone would win or lose a bit and the rake would eat
everyone up. But poker's a hard game and there are bad players, who
aren't working on their game and aren't changing their lazy bad poker habits.
This is a huge advantage for the better players who can recognize
and exploit the flaws of the bad players.

A Poker Professional
====================

You don't have to play for a living to treat poker professionally. As a
regular player you should be treating the game seriously. You can
still enjoy the game, in fact the better you play the game the
more you'll enjoy it and the more satisfaction you'll get from poker.

THE FULL BET RULE

Last updated: 20180919

Almost ten years ago (2011) I wrote a book on Pub Poker Tournaments,
"Winning Pub Poker". There was a chapter on Rules, quite
detailed as Pub Poker tournaments are usually self-dealt, so I
had to give lots of dealing advice as well as mentioniong
the online resoures Robert's Rules of Poker and the
Poker Tourmanent Directors of America (TDA) rules.

The Robert of Robert's Rules of Poker is none other
than Poker author Bob Ciaffone, who has written some
good material on Pot Limit Omaha and other forms of poker.

There's an entire book on poker dealing, published by leading
poker book publisher Two Plus Two. The Professional Poker Dealer's
Handbook, by Dan Paymar, Donna Harris and Mason Malmuth, is
an entire book about poker from the Casino Dealer's point of view,
I got my hands on a copy recently and I'll read it soon to
understand a little more about what the dealers are doing.

I have no interest in becoming a Dealer myself, I just want
to know as much about the game as possible. Don Bradman
took the cricket Umpire's exam while still a player; just so
he could be sure that he was absolutely on top of the rules
and laws of cricket.

Of course in a professionally dealt Casino Cash Game you
don't have to worry about a lot of these things.

One rule that is important in Tournaments and crucial in PLO Cash
games is the Full Bet Rule. Here's what I wrote in "Winning Pub Poker".

Winning Pub Poker: The Full Bet Rule
====================================

This is a rule you often see completely ignored in pub games. 
This is part of the price you pay for playing
in pub tournaments- they're cheap to play and you play against
bad opponents, but rules sometimes get ignored or incorrectly applied.

Even a major online site once applied this rule incorrectly in
a cash game, and to their credit refunded the player disadvantaged
when he pointed it out to customer support at the site concerned.

Here's how the full bet rule works. A player bets. Another player 
raises all-in for more than that bet, but less than what a minimum raise is. 
The all-in raiser doesn't have enough chips to put in a full raise. 
Other players call. When action returns to the original better, he 
cannot reraise, he can only fold or call the all-in player's bet.

To put some numbers in it, imagine Susan Smallblind has 10,000,
Bill Bigblind has 4,000 and Danny Dealer has 17,000. After the flop, 
Susan bets 2,500. Bill goes all in for 4,000 which is less 
than a full raise. Danny calls the 4,000 and action is now back on Susan.
Susan can now either fold or just call the 4,000. She can't go all-in 
for her 10,000.

On the other hand, if Susan had bet 2,000, Bill goes all in for 4,000
and Danny calls the 4,000 Susan can now push all in for 10,000 since
Bill's all-in was a full raise, re-opening the action to Susan.

Since all players expect that "In No Limit Holdem you
can bet all your chips at any time", and that's almost always true,
application of the full bet rule is sketchy at best.

Here's a single sentence that sums up the full-bet rule:
"If it wasn't a full raise, betting is not re-opened".

Poker TDA rules: "In no-limit and pot-limit, an all-in bet of less
than a full raise does not reopen betting to a player who has already
acted".

Make sure you understand "re-open" and "already acted". It's only
Susan who can't raise in this betting round. Danny can still go all-in for
his 17,000 when it's his turn.

In 1/3 PLO, the Full Bet Rule turns up a lot in the preflop betting round.
There will be a few shortstacks in the $25-$60 range and some players
who've just rebought for the minimum $100. These players understand that
their best chance of doubling up is to get one on one against another
player.

The best result for a shortstack of $25 is for a big stack to raise to $10.
The shortstack raises all-in for $25. This qualifies as a full raise
because the betting was $3 raised to $10 so the next full raise needs to be
to $17 or more. Now there's a bunch of callers of that $25, action returns
to the big stack who pot raises to $180 or so. Everyone folds and the
$25 shortstack gets to a showdown heads up against the big stack and there's
about $110 in the pot. The shortstack can win all those $25 calls even
though those players have been blasted out of the pot already. And the
big stack gets a one on one shot against the short stack and only has
to worry about one player outdrawing him.

If you're considering calling an all-in shortstack preflop, make sure
you know if the Full Bet Rule applies here. If a big stack still has
a reraise option, you could be blasted out of the pot preflop and
waste your call and not even see a flop.

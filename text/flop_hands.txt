HANDS ON THE FLOP

Last Updated: 20181228

You know from your Holdem experience how to read a Flop and see what
hands and draws might be out there. There's not much happening
on a flop of T52 rainbow. Whoever is ahead on the flop will probably
be ahead on the river; although a hand like KQ could stay in and pair
their overcard. A bet on that T52 flop will often win the pot and end
the hand right now.

In contrast, there's lots of potential on the flop J98 two diamonds.
Two pair, pair with straight draw, made straight and flush draw are
all possible hands connecting with this flop. The best hand on the flop
will often get outdrawn.

A flop with widely spaced rainbow cards is called a Dry Flop and a flop
with straight and flush chances is called a Wet Flop. Because
straight draws run so wide in Omaha, you need a very widely spaced
flop to be truly straight-dry. There needs to be four gaps between
each card. There are so few of these flops that I'll list them:
K83, K82, K72, Q72. That's all of them. If there's only a three-gap,
like K92, someone with exactly QJT has flopped a 9-out nut straight
"inside wrap" draw.

No unpaired flop containing an Ace is straight-dry.

A flop with a pair on it I call a Dope flop and I'll discuss separately.
Also to be discussed separately are three-of-the-same-suit monochrome flops.

You want to flop big in PLO; either top set that can improve to the
best possible full house, a nut flush draw, or a big straight wrap.
Really good hands flop combinations of these, which I'll look at later.

If you don't connect strongly with the flop, chances are excellent that
someone else in this hand has, and will easily beat you in this hand.
Don't bring a knife to a gunfight, get out cheaply this hand. A much
better opportunity will come soon; when they've got the knife and you've
got the cannon.

Flop betting in a multiway Omaha pot that isn't already huge is pretty
honest. A pot sized bet on a JT4 flop normally comes from top set; and
the callers have straight or flush draws. Depending on the hands involved,
top set might not be the favourite to win.

TOP SET
=======

Jamming with Top Set is a PLO tradition; charging the maximum for hands
to try to outdraw you. You can't stop draws staying in; as the betting
is Pot Limit. A good 12-out draw is getting about the right price in
Pot Limit; if he's being charged 2 to 1 for his call as he is about
25% to make his draw on the next card. So calling pot sized bets isn't
going too much against the odds; you're getting 2 to 1 on your call
with more money to be made if your draw comes in.

Also if the pot isn't big on the flop, it doesn't cost too much in
absolute terms to call a bet on the flop. A No Limit pot can get
big at any moment with an all-in overbet, a Pot Limit pot gets huge
only as new bets go in. So calling a flop bet while the bets aren't
yet too big is a good strategy.

If you bet the pot with top set on a dry board like J62 and pick
up the pot as it is, that's a good result for you because
The Turn Changes Everything. Checking the flop and coming out
firing on a board of J627 two hearts is bad poker because someone
with QT98 two hearts, who completely missed the flop, now has
a pile of outs and will happily call your turn bet and win a big
pot from you when any of his outs comes in on the river.

FIXME: get the number of outs for the calling hand.

One great result of pot-betting top set is you can get
reraised by middle set or top two pair. Middle set is also
worried about protecting his hand against straight and flush
runouts. If Middle Set gets his chips in the middle against
your top set, you can play for his stack one-on-one when
he's get just one out or is even drawing dead. There's no easier
money to be made in poker.

Once I had top set on a T72 flop, two spades, bet it out and got all in
heads-up against someone who raised me. The board ran out T7298
with three spades and it looked like I'd be losing this pot
to any draw whatsoever. I won the pot, because the guy who re-raised
me on the flop had just top two pair, T7. Two other players with draws
were forced out because of this furious flop betting, each would
have outdrawn me. Sensational.

Omaha is a nut game and flopped top set in Omaha is like flopped
Top Pair/Top Kicker in Holdem. It's likely to be the best hand right
now but it's not likely to be the best hand once all the cards are out.
Sets only turn into full houses 20% of the time and if they don't,
there's five unpaired board cards and it's too easy for other
holdings to have straights or flushes.

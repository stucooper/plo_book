HANDS ON THE FLOP

Last Updated: 20181227

You know from your Holdem experience how to read a Flop and see what
hands and draws might be out there. There's not much happening
on a flop of T52 rainbow. Whoever is ahead on the flop will probably
be ahead on the river; although a hand like KQ could stay in and pair
their overcard. A bet on that T52 flop will often win the pot and end
the hand right now.

In contrast, there's lots of potential on the flop J98 two diamonds.
Two pair, pair with straight draw, made straight and flush draw are
all possible hands connecting with this flop. The best hand on the flop
will often get outdrawn.

A flop with widely spaced rainbow cards is called a Dry Flop and a flop
with straight and flush chances is called a Wet Flop. Because
straight draws run so wide in Omaha, you need a very widely spaced
flop to be truly straight-dry. There needs to be four gaps between
each card. There are so few of these flops that I'll list them:
K83, K82, K72, Q72. That's all of them. If there's only a three-gap,
like K92, someone with exactly QJT has flopped a 9-out nut straight
"inside wrap" draw. 

No unpaired flop containing an Ace is straight-dry.

A flop with a pair on it I call a Dope flop and I'll discuss separately.
Also to be discussed separately are three-of-the-same-suit monochrome flops.

You want to flop big in PLO; either top set that can improve to the
best possible full house, a nut flush draw, or a big straight wrap.
Really good hands flop combinations of these, which I'll look at later.

If you don't connect strongly with the flop, chances are excellent that
someone else in this hand has, and will easily beat you in this hand.
Don't bring a knife to a gunfight, get out cheaply this hand. A much
better opportunity will come soon; when they've got the knife and you've
got the cannon.

Flop betting in a multiway Omaha pot that isn't already huge is pretty
honest. A pot sized bet on a JT4 flop normally comes from top set; and
the callers have straight or flush draws. Depending on the hands involved,
top set might not be the favourite to win.

TOP SET
=======

Jamming with Top Set is a PLO tradition; charging the maximum for hands
to try to outdraw you. You can't stop draws staying in; as the betting
is Pot Limit. A good 12-out draw is getting about the right price in
Pot Limit; if he's being charged 2 to 1 for his call as he is about
25% to make his draw on the next card.

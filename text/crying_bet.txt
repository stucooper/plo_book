THE CRYING BET

Last updated: 20190115

Most of the time in Poker you want to be Last To Act.
Position is power. You get to see what the earlier players
do before it's your action. This helps you fold when you're behind,
bet when you're ahead, losing less money when the pot
isn't yours and winning more when it is.

Here's an interesting First To Act river
play I use that I call the Crying Bet.

A Crying Bet is a River bet you make with a medium strength non-nut hand
that you would crying call with, facing a bet from a later player.
Omaha hands are so strong that "medium strength" here means
a big set, pretty strong straights or high flushes.

When making a crying bet, you want your stack to be less
than the pot. If your stack is a lot bigger than the pot,
you run the risk of losing more than you should when
you run into the nuts. If your stack is noticeably bigger
than the current pot, you should probably just check/call
and save yourself money when you are behind, since the most
you'll have to call is the pot.

If you bet an amount n that's less than the pot size P,
you can be raised to 3n+P; so even betting as little as
1/3 pot means you might have to pay 2P to see the showdown,
if you're raised the maximum. If the pot is 300 and you bet
100, a later player can pot-raise you to 600, and he's usually
only doing that with the Nuts. So don't use crying bets when
you've got tons of chips left, it's far too expensive when
you're not the winner.

Remember that you've decided already that if you check and
a later player bets, you're going to call that bet. You've already
figured that out in your heart of hearts. You're not likely to
find a super tell from the river bettor and make a tough fold.
Your stack size and the strength of your hand dictate a call.

By getting your money in first with your Crying Bet, you take away the
"check behind" option from later actors, who must now fold
or call, sometimes with worse hands than yours. You thus realise
full value for your hands. If you'd checked, the worse hands often
check behind and you don't get that full value.

All Omaha players with any experience at all soon understand how
strong a hand you need to have to bet on the river, and they
soon get used to checking behind semi-strong hands on the river.
When you've got the stronger hand but you check and a semi-strong hand
that you beat checks behind, you didn't get full value.

Now and then I Crying Bet right into the Nuts and lose, but remember
I knew I was going to Crying Call anyhow. Instead of the river betting
going Me: Check Her: Bet Me: Crying call and lose, the betting goes
Me: Crying Bet Her: Easy call and win. I lose my stack either way.

Really good players at the table will see that you're sometimes
betting the river with a non-nut hand. You're not a complete
nut-peddlar. This will help you in future hands when you're
first to act  and this time you DO have the nuts.

But when I'm the Crying Bet winner I win more money a lot of the time.
Let's say I've got $70 left and there's 3 players contesting a pot
of $200. After some action preflop, betting has gone quiet and the
final board is KJT38. I've missed flush and full house chances
with JT97 but I've rivered what looks to be a winning straight.
If anyone had AQ they should've bet this earlier to protect
their hand, Q9 could be out there to beat me but I believe I'm
the winner here. Here's the four ways the river betting can play out.

(A) I check. The other two players check. I win $185 and now have $255.
(B) I check. One player checks, last to act bets $70, I call and
    win and now have $325
(C) I bet all in for $70. One player folds, another calls and I have $325.
(D) I bet all in for $70. Both players fold and I have $255.

I've taken out Star's $15 rake in my final stack size. The four
scenarios aren't equally probable, and since I'm first to act
I get to control whether we'll see (A)/(B) occur or (C)/(D).

Remember that any competent Omaha player soon gets used to
checking behind on the river. I'd estimate that a set will check
behind on KJT38 80% of the time. Since I've already determined
that I'm going to Crying Call, I can go ahead and Crying Bet.

Never crying bet a straight on flush boards. There's far too much
chance that you'll get flat called by a medium or low flush.
Sometimes the flush isn't there and you pick up the pot as it
is, but betting extra into a flush board is giving your chips
away; any flush calls and you're giving chips away. A straight on
a flush board isn't a crying call hand anyway, so doesn't
qualify as the sort of hand you Crying Bet with.

World Class Play
================

This is my all-time favourite Crying Bet. I'm playing 8654 and
three of us take a flop for $20 each which comes 975 two diamonds.
Two of us check and there's a $60 pot bet from last position which I call
and so does the third player. Turn card is a black Ten but I still
think I'm good on T975 but now I face a $240 pot bet. I call and the
third player undercalls for his last $110, there's now a $260 side pot
and a main pot of $550. The river comes a repeat 7 and on the final board
of T9775 I Crying Bet $300.

"World Class play, mate" grumbles the last-position player and folds 86
face up. I'm awarded the $260 side pot and win the main pot too,
the all-in player having T9 for top two pair on the turn but
no full house. Instead of having to split the two pots with the same
straight as mine, I scoop the lot. Because I'd called the flop,
called the turn and only come out firing on the river when the board
paired, the last-position player put me on a full house and a
lead-changing bet, whereas in fact this was my Crying Bet and got him
to fold.

"Yes, that one was World Class" I said.

"Donk"
=====

A First-to-Act bet is called a "Donk" bet in some of the literature.
My Crying Bet is a specific Donk, a Donk in the circumstance where
your hand is strong enough to Crying Call with.

Final Crying Bet Advice
=======================

Don't overdo it. Don't start to Crying Bet in every pot
and remember in Omaha as in Holdem it's much better to be
In Position, Last to Act than it is to be Out of Position,
First to Act. Poker is about winning the most with your
winning hands, and the Crying Bet helps you do this.

So the conditions for a Crying Bet, normally made on the river, are

(1) A strong hand you'll crying call with should Last-to-Act bet
(2) A stack size less than twice the pot.

Don't forget "Check to induce"
==============================

Remember that sometimes the way you make money in poker on the
river is by checking, letting Last-to-Act bluff and then calling.
Last-to-Act can't bluff if you've already Crying Bet your stack
all-in at him, he gets an easy fold. So sometimes the best line for you
to take on the river is to check and then make your Crying Call,
which some of the time will be snapping off someone's bluff.

This line does of course allow check-behind; if your stack is so
tiny compared to the pot that you'll obviously call on the river,
check to induce probably won't work and you should Crying Bet.

When you're inducing a bluff you don't make any money from raising
because the bluffer won't call; so just flat call the (possible) bluff
and see if you win. If it was a bluff then you win and your
raise wouldn't have been called. If you're paying off a better
hand you save a bit of money by just calling.

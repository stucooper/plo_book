SESSIONS

Last updated: 20190630

Cash poker is played in sessions. Your poker sessions starts
with your arrival on the casino floor and ends with your
departure from the casino floor. In the last long chapter,
The Leaving Decision, I wrote a lot about when to end your session
and about how losing $300 less each time you have a losing session
adds money to your wallet, even though it doesn't feel like it as
you walk out of the casino a loser for the session. In this chapter,
I'll look more at a single session.

Breathe in
==========

Some players try to hit the ground running and get their stack
committed in their first, second or third hand. This is great
when it works (it's always fun to double up or triple up early)
but very expensive when it fails. It also does nothing for your
table image and means it'll be very hard for you to run bluffs
because the other players can see you're happy to get it in with
a very wide range of hands; you're not a high pairs top-set miner.

You don't know anything about the table when you first sit down.
Even if there's six regulars there you know well, you can't tell
how people are feeling and running tonight, though if someone
is sitting behind a $1600 stack it's obvious they're running well.

Rushing and overplaying your hands is a mistake in any kind
of Poker and it's worse in Omaha because
(a) you can hit a good looking flop and still be miles behind.
(b) your whole stack gets committed so quickly and easily.
(c) if you wait a few hands more you'll get dealt a much
    better starting hand which you can play strongly. You don't have
    to wait too long for a great hand in Omaha; so wait up to half
    a dozen hands for your first great hand; don't overplay a
    marginal hand right off the bat.
(d) you're not going to bluff anyone off this early in your session.

So breathe in. Look around the table, get a feel for how the game
is going. See what patterns you can see preflop for the first
few hands; are there five players paying $10 for a flop, are
there some step raisers, are there deadstack nothreats? You can't
amswer any of those questions having just sat down but you should
know the answer to all of them after four hands.

There's a great saying in Test Match Cricket that "A batting team
can't win a Test by lunch on Day One, but they can lose one". If
your openers blaze away and they're 1/135 at lunch that's a great
start but still only a solid foundation for a great first day.
But if nobody knuckles down and you're 7/63 at lunch, you'll
lose this Test no matter what happens from here.

Depending on your arrival time, you might have a long wait
before you finally get your Omaha seat. You need to work
harder than ever to breathe in when you've endured a long wait
to get your poker fix.

Buyin size
==========

I recommend a buyin size of $150, but you have to respect your buyin.
If you keep chasing longshots with it, you'll lose buyin after
buyin after buyin and soon you're in the hole $450 or $600 and
it's a long way back from there. If $150 isn't enough money to keep
you away from longshots, maybe you should buy in bigger, even for
the maximum $300.

With $300 you'll stay away from the longshots but more of your money
is at risk if you hit an Omaaaagh hand. You're not playing the
Shortstack approach anymore, as you've bought in for the maximum $300.
You've got too much on the table to join the Party Hands. But if you
get a double up, your stack is now around the $570-$620 mark, which
is a great size to play the big pots with.

Shortstacking is so important in PLO that I strongly believe that
the $150 buyin is the right size.

How much money to bring
=======================

Allow me to share a slightly personal secret. My daily ATM withdrawal limit
is $1,000. It used to be $2,000 but a couple of years ago my bank
changed it to $1,000. I could go and visit my bank in person and have
it changed to a higher amount if I wanted to, but $1,000 works well for
me.

For most of my sessions I arrive with $900 in my wallet and my ATM card;
which means my maximum session loss is $1900, provided that my ATM
withdrawal is made after midnight. If I've used my ATM card before then
and I run really badly, I risk losing my arrival cash plus two
ATM withdrawals (eg at 11:45pm and 02:20am) which makes a maximum loss
of $2,900 which is a crushing loss.

If I've got a lot of cash at home I will often turn up with $1500 or $1800
in my wallet and leave my ATM card at home. Now my loss is limited to the
cash I've brought with me, and once that's gone, it's time to go home.

Since my buyin is normally $150, if I lose $1500 in a session then I've
lost a full ten buyins. I've sometimes made a miracle recovery from this
position and booked a small win or a "real money in my pocket" manageable
loss of $150-$600 but many more times I've made the loss even worse
by blowing another $600 to $1000. You have to pull the handbrake sooner or
later.

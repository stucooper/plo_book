POKER GAMES: DRAW, STUD AND FLOP

Last updated: 20181225

Most poker games fall into one of three categories: Draw games,
Stud Games or Flop Games. Within each category is a group of
related games, which vary in the number of cards used, the
number of upcards and downcards, the betting structure and
the Hand Rankings used.

Broadly speaking, Poker was Draw Games until the 1950s, Stud Games
from the 1950s to the 1980s and Flop Games from the 1980s until today. You
can see the migration in the two different editions of Super System.
In Super System (1978) there's chapters on Draw Poker, both
Draw Poker High and Lowball. There's also sections on Stud Hi,
Stud Hi-Lo, Limit Holdem and No Limit Holdem. In Super System 2 (2005)
traditional Draw Poker has disappeared, Mike Caro
grumbling in his Tips and Tells chapter that "Draw Poker isn't Dead!".
There's just two non-flop-game chapters, Deuce-to-Seven Triple Draw
and Seven Card Stud Hi-Lo (Eight or Better).

The new flop game in Super System 2 is Omaha, with an Omaha Hi-Lo
chapter and Pot Limit Omaha High chapter.

If there was a Super System 3 coming out soon, the games
would be No Limit Holdem, Pot Limit Omaha, Pot Limit 5-Card Omaha and maybe Courchevel, an
Omaha variant where you see the first card of the flop in the pre-flop
betting round, and the "flop" reveals two more cards of the community.

Poker has evolved from Draw to Stud to Flop.

Draw Games
----------

In Draw Poker, each player has a unique hand with all cards
private. Players discard cards and draw new ones to improve
their hand. Some games allow three drawing rounds to do this.
Before the Texas Holdem explosion, most people would understand
"Classic Poker" to be 5-card single draw high poker; played with
a 52-card deck no jokers. This is the game that Paul Newman
beats Robert Shaw's Doyle Lonnegan in the classic poker-on-a-train
scene in the movie "The Sting". "The Sting", a story of 
grifters in Chicago in the 1930s, is the only poker/gambling movie
to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, and features the
classic charismatic pairing of Robert Redford and Paul Newman.

New Draw games have turned up in the last few years,
Deuce-to-Seven Triple Draw (described by Daniel Negreanu
in Super System 2) and Badugi.

Some Draw Poker games use a Joker, making a 53-card deck. The
rules for how the Joker can be used vary from game to game.

Stud Games
----------

In Stud Poker, players have unique hands with some of their
cards private ("downcards") and some visible to all
players ("upcards"). Watching the upcards of the other players
and remembering what upcards were folded by players
now out of the hand is a key skill of the game.

Seven Card Stud is the most enduring of the Stud games. Players
start with two downcards and one upcard. There is
a round of betting and after each of three betting rounds
players still in the hand get another upcard (the rounds
and the cards are called Fourth Street, Fifth Street, Sixth
Street). The final card, Seventh Street, is dealt face
down followed by the last round of betting.
Players must make their best Five-card poker hand
from their own Seven cards (Four of which are upcards and
known to everyone at the table).

Australia's most prolific World Series of Poker bracelet
winner is Jeff Lisandro, who often plays the big PLO games
at The Star when he's in Sydney. Lisandro's first 4 bracelets
were won in Las Vegas and were all in Seven Card stud events.
In 2008 Jeff won Bracelets in Stud, Stud Eight-or-Better Hi/Lo
and Stud Low (Razz) and was declared WSOP Player of the Year.
He has since won a European WSOP bracelet and an Asia-Pacific
WSOP bracelet, both in Pot Limit Omaha. In 2018 Lisandro
narrowly missed a Seventh WSOP bracelet, finishing second in
a Las Vegas Seven Card Stud event.

An earlier game than Seven-Card Stud was Five-Card Stud, where
players start with one private and one exposed card and simply
get more exposed cards at Third Street, Fourth Street and Fifth
Street. It's the game featured in probably the earliest
classic Hollywood Poker movie, The Cinncinnatti Kid starring
Steve McQueen.

Texas Holdem started as a variation of Seven Card Stud.
Instead of 4 upcards and 3 downcards per player,
there's 5 shared upcards and 2 downcards. You don't have to
track all those visible upcards and the ones that have been
folded by player earlier in the hand. You've got the
Board there to look at whenever you need it, and it's the
same Board for every player.

Dan Harrington writes that Holdem hits the sweet spot of
the right amount of information visible to the observant player.
In 5-card Draw Poker there's no information visible, everyone has
downcards. In 5-card Stud Poker there's too much information, everyone
holding 4 upcards and just a single downcard. Holdem gets it just right
with 5 shared upcards and two downcards per player.

Flop games
----------

The newest stream of poker games and by far the most popular today
are the Flop games.

All flop games follow this structure:

  All players at the table dealt unique hole cards
  Preflop Betting
  3 card flop produced
  Flop Betting
  4th card ("turn") prouduced
  Turn Betting
  5th card ("river") produced
  River Betting
  Showdown

Besides Texas Holdem and Omaha there's a third Flop Game called
Pineapple, which you might come across in Home Games. Many
years ago when pub poker operators were able to run sneaky
Cash games under the guise of "Chip Chops", I played a lot of
Pineapple in a pub in the suburb of Ermington.

The flop games differ in the number of hole cards you get, the
betting structure on each betting round and the showdown rules.

No Limit Holdem: 2 hole cards, No Limit betting, 0+5 or 1+4 or 2+3 showdown
Limit Holdem: Showdown rules as for NLH but fixed betting on each street.
  Normally the turn and river betting amount is twice the preflop and flop
  betting amount. This used to be the main form of Holdem Poker, but
  has been eclipsed by the popularity of No Limit.
Limit Omaha: Betting as in Limit Holdem. 4 hole cards, 2+3 showdown.
  Like Limit Holdem, this used to be the main form of Omaha but
  was soon overtaken by Pot Limit.
Pot Limit Omaha: Showdown rules as for Limit Omaha, all betting streets
  are Pot Limit. The most popular form of Omaha.
Pineapple: 3 hole cards, one is discarded by still-active players
  before the turn. Players take their two remaining cards to the
  river and Holdem showdown rules apply. This game can be played
  Limit, Pot Limit or No Limit.

Flop games evolve over time. Pot Limit Holdem used to be a popular
game but has all but disappeared. Limit Omaha can be found in
Melbourne's Crown Casino on Friday and Saturday nights and is played
by very old players, refugees from the Australian fixed limit
community card game Manila. And I've played No Limit Omaha, an
extremely rare form of the game which I found years ago in
Dunedin Casino in New Zealand's South Island. I doubt it's still
played No Limit. I do remember taking down a pot with a few $40 callers
with a big $400 all-in shove (with QQJT), that gave me a satisfied
feeling.

You know what the Nuts is
=========================

One of the big advantages of flop games is you know what the Nut hand is.
In Seven Card stud, playing a flush against a player with upcards of
5689 who you think has an "obvious" straight, you can still lose when
he reveals his downcards are 559 and he has a full house!
Draw Poker, with 5 hidden cards, is even more mysterious. But in
Flop games, with a 5 card board and only two downcards to be showndown,
you know if a flush or full house is possible. If there isn't a
pair or three of a kind on the board, full houses and quads are
impossible. If there isn't three of a suit on the board, a
flush is impossible.

You don't have to track upcards
===============================

In Seven Card stud you have to look at the upcards of the other players
all the time, and adjust your own outs and estimate of the strength
of your hand and your draws based on what other cards you know
are in other people's hands. You also have to remember what upcards
have already been folded by players now out of the hand. You don't
have to do any of this tiring work in Holdem. The upcards are the
shared community and it's there for you and the other players
to look at, any time you like during the hand.

Other Omaha games
=================

A popular variant of Omaha is "Omaha Hi/Lo" or "Omaha/8". In this
game half the pot goes to the lowest 5-card hand, provided it is
lower than nine-low. Like in Razz, straights and flushes don't
count against the best low hand, which is the Wheel, A2345.
The other half of the pot is awarded to the best High hand, where
straights and flushes do count. Omaha Hi/Lo is normally played
with Limit betting, though it can be played Pot Limit.
If nobody has a hand 8-low or lower, the whole pot is awarded to
the High hand.

Some High-Low games, especially in home games, were played with
Declare Showdown Rules. If you were still in the hand after
the final betting round, you had to declare if you were playing
for the low pot, the high pot, or both pots. There would be
all kinds of Declare rules, sometimes players would
declare in betting order and late-acting players could
change their minds based on earlier declarations, in other
rules  players would simultaenously reveal one, two or three
chips in their hands to show if they were playing for
low, high, or both. If you got your declaration wrong
you won more pots than you said you would, you could lose
your money. I've never played Declare games, they sound pretty tough.

Omaha can be played with 5 hole cards. This means only 8 players
can be dealt in (if you deal 9 players that's 45 cards and you don't
have enough for 5 community cards and 3 burn cards). I've also
played it (in home games) with a 3+2 showdown rule not 2+3.
That game didn't work so well so the main variation I've played in
home games is 5 hole cards, with the traditional 2+3 showdown.

A lot of Omaha books try to cover all the Omaha formats; Limit Omaha
High, Limit Omaha Hi/Lo, Pot Limit Omaha High, Pot Limit Omaha Hi/Lo
and also Omaha in tournaments with escalating blinds. It can be
hard to find the information you want for the game you're playing.

This book covers one form and format of Omaha only:
Pot Limit Omaha High Cash. I've mentioned Omaha/8 and we can now
forget about it completely.

Mixed-game tournaments
======================

The tradional mixed-game tournament was called HORSE.
This mixed 2 flop games (Holdem and Omaha) with three Stud games
(Razz, Seven Card Stud High, Seven Card Stud Eight-or-better Hi-lo).
For a long time this was the main mixed-game tournament and seen
as the widest test of all-round poker skill.

A new all-round tournament is 8-game; the same games as Horse,
plus Omaha Hi-Lo, Deuce to Seven Triple Draw and Limit Holdem.
Now there's Four flop games, Three Stud games and a Draw game.

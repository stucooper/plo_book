TROUBLE HANDS

Last updated: 20180713

Before we look at the hands you should play in Omaha, I'll
warn you about some stack-killing hands you'd do well to avoid.

There's a class of hands I call "Trouble Hands", some of the
other poker literature calls these hands "Sucker hands". In Holdem
these are high but not high enough holdings like A9, KT, QJ.
When they flop top pair in a raised pot, making top pair
decent kicker, they're often a long way behind top pair better
kicker. So even when they flop decently they're Low Confidence
Hands. They can't be bet strongly (which means they win small when
they're ahead) and they're OK-enough to call with (which means they
lose more when they're behind). Win small, lose big. This is the
exact opposite of the Number One rule of gambling: Win big, lose
small. So if you're dealt a Trouble Holding, you can save yourself
money and some tough decisions by just folding it preflop. TAHITM.

In PLO the trouble holdings are pocket pairs like 66,55,44,33,22;
low straight connectors like 5432 and non-nut suited cards like
Jack-high hearts, Queen-high spades and so on. These hands are
seductive because you miss most flops and get an easy fold for 
a tiny loss; maybe you've called $10 preflop and whiffed. Your
stack goes from $220 to $210. No problem. Where the real problem 
lies is when you hit a good flop and get your stack in and you're 
still behind to a much better hand and you're smoked.

You flop bottom set and lose your stack to middle set. You play 6332,
get a 754 flop and lose your stack to T986. Your stack goes
from $220 to Zero. Now you see the problem.

In Holdem the trouble hands normally lose on kicker; in Omaha
the troble hands lose to same-rung hands of higher rank.
Small sets lose to medium sets lose to high sets.
Small straights lose to medium straights lose to high straight.
Small flushes lose to medium flushes lose to high flushes.

The Deuce is a poison card in your holding. No good
PLO holdings contain a Deuce. The only good Deuce is suited to an Ace
and even then you wish it was a different rank, still suited to the Ace.
In the holding AhJT2h sure you're now a nut flush chance in Hearts
but it'd be so much better if that 2h was the Jh, Th, or 9h.
A pair of Deuces isn't good because the only set it flops is
bottom set, which is a Low Confidence Hand and a Stack Killer.

The Trey is less poison than the Deuce, but it's still pretty toxic.
It plays OK in the bottom straight gap rundown hands like 7653 or
the bottom pair of 5433. You need very specific cards to flop, so
these hands are very speculative and will be folded to most flops,
but if you get exactly the right flop you can get a hand you can
go to war with. Most of the time a Trey in your holding will be
a dangler. You really won't go wrong folding any holding with a 3
in it apart from 7653 and 5433. And you don't have to play those
holdings either.

Pocket 55 is the smallest pocket pair I can remember flopping
the Overfull with. On a flop of 544 I won lots from two players
who both had a four, and probably thought I had a straight draw
chance like 567 and not the flopped overfull that I had.

After you've played a lot of PLO, you develop an almost mystical
relationship with the pocket pairs and the sets they generate.
It's superstitious based on what pairs have been good to you and
which haven't. Personally I find QQ sets better than KK sets.
44 seems to have made Quads for me a lot more than any other
pair, and it's nice at showdown to say "four fours". 

Bottom set needs to Quad
------------------------

Bob Ciaffone shows a hand where a player with bottom set
on the turnboard, currently ahead, can't win unless
exactly his quad card comes on the river. And there's only
four players in this hand! The other hands are top three pair
(so other repeaters Luckboat them), two-suit flush draws and 
big straight wraps. The hands are:

AK22
JT87h
AsJs5c3c
Q97d4

and the turnboard is

Qc9c2s4s

The JT87 wrap  wins if the river is a red K,J,T or 8.
The A53x wrap  wins if the river is a red 6,5,3 or A
The Q94x 2 pair wins if the river is a    Q, 9 or 4
The AJ53 spade/club draw wins if the river is black 
  and doesn't pair the board. This includes 
  both remaining sevens. (it must be 7s or 7c)
The AK22 bottom set wins if (and only if) the river 
  is the case 2.

I simplified Ciaffone's example slightly by putting both
the spade and club draw in the same holding. The take-home
point to remember from this example is that bottom set is
often smoked; if it isn't behind already to a better set
it could be fading a deck of outs on the river. In this
example, the entire deck. Every card besides the single
quad card is a loser.

Since you know in advance that low sets can be stack killers
in Omaha, why even play low pocket pairs preflop? Wait for better
hands and don't give your stack away when you flop
a losing set.

DOCTOR STRAIGHT FACT: I regularly win the stacks of
players who flop the 222 bottom set, when I've got top set.
Normally my top set is in the 99,TT,JJ,QQ range. Here
are some of my favourite flops: Q92, J72, T52, 942. It's
great having the bottom sets in the pot with me because
they normally raise pot on the flop and force flush draws
and straight draws to fold. This leaves me heads up with
my top set as a 96% favourite or sometimes a 100% favourite.
It doesn't get any better than that.

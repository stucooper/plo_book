ADVICE FOR NEW PLAYERS

Last updated: 20180726

If you're new to Omaha, here's some suggestions to help you in
your first few sessions. As you get more experienced you'll
adopt the same habits as the regulars but when you're starting
out there's some things you should keep in mind to avoid
costly beginner's mistakes

Prevent exposure of your holding
--------------------------------

In Holdem you soon learn to lift the corners of your two hole cards
and remember them for the rest of the hand. You're playing 
King-Ten of Diamonds or Ace-Nine offsuit or Pocket Tens. 
In Omaha you've got Four cards to handle and it's harder to 
squeeze them and see the cards in your
holding. You can't hold the cards in the air 20 centimetres in front
of your face where everyone on your side of the table can see them.
Be conscious more than usual that you're not accidentally flashing
your holding to other players.

I like to arrange my holding so it runs high card to low cards,
left to right. If I'm dealt 5sKs7J I'll rearrange the cards so
when I look at them they say KsJ75s.

Re-check your holding
---------------------

It's hard to remember your 4-card holding during a hand, normally
you remember what you hope to hit. With KsJ75s I remember
"King-Jack, King high in spades". I haven't remembered well the
ranks of the 7 and the 5. If a Dope Flop like T66 comes, I'll
recheck my holding to see if I have a 6. Preflop I was hoping for 
Broadway action or KJ two pair or some spade flush action but
now that the flop is T66 I'll recheck my cards and hope to see a Six.

Limp Preflop
------------

If you're a Holdemite you might be a fan of the theory that
you always come in for a raise, or fold. In Omaha, limping
preflop is very much an option.

Know the Full-Bet Rule
----------------------

Knowing the Full-Bet rule is crucial in Omaha. Make sure
you understand it.

Don't be afraid of showing a losing hand at showdown
----------------------------------------------------

If you've got any kind of doubt in a Showdown, table your hand.
Once your hand is tabled, Cards Speak and the Dealer and other
players can help identify your best hand. The worst sin in poker
is to fold a hand at showdown that was the winner or would have
split the pot.

Showdown etiquette isn't great with some players and they'll
say "Straight" or "Flush" or otherwise miscall their hand in an
attempt to get you to fold a winner. The 2+3 Showdown Rule takes
a lot of getting used to, and since you're used to Holdem you'll
be seeing a lot of 1+4 winning hands that the "winner" shows you
that simply don't play in Omaha. Take a few seconds to make entirely
sure that the winner has the hand he says he has, under 2+3 rules,
and don't be afraid to table your hand if you're unsure.

Don't straddle
--------------

As a new player to Omaha, you'll want to play some hands and get
as much experience for the cost of your buyins as you can.
Straddling $6, paying twice as much out of position when you haven't
even seen your cards, goes against your Experience Goals.

Sometimes most players at the table are straddling and they'll put
you under verbal pressure to straddle also. Don't do it.
Straddling won't make you one of the boys and it doesn't disguise
the fact you're new to Omaha.

Raise with the big straight draws
---------------------------------

Holdemites aren't used to the strength of big Omaha draws. If your
holding and the flop make a 5-card continuum, and you're above the board,
and the flop isn't single-suited, Jam it!

Avoid tricky play
-----------------

Remember that Omaha isn't a trapping game, and you need to Do Your
Own Betting. Sets get outdrawn all the time, you need to protect
them by betting the pot on the flop and later streets.

Leave if your stack gets big
----------------------------

It's a lot easier playing a $100 stack than it is playing a $400 stack.
Plays that are correct for the short stack are wrong for the bigger
stack. You need to walk before you can run, so master your short stack
play and then work towards bigger stack player later. A win of $200 or $300
should be enough to take at this stage of your Omaha evolution.

I myself will cash out a stack of $600 on my first buyin and will always
ask myself if a cashout is in order once my stack is $800 or more.
The more experience you get, the more comfortable you will be with
playing bigger stacks but with that much real money on offer on the
table it's well worth cashing out.

Know the Party Hands
--------------------

Make sure you've read and understood the chapter on Party Hands. This is
great Omaha knowledge that many regulars don't have. Just
knowing the Party Hands in advance puts you ahead of many of the
other players. You can make good money playing good Party Hands, even
as an Omaha beginner.

Don't draw to low flushes
-------------------------

One of the traps Omaha has for Holdemites is low flushes. In Holdem
a low flush using both of your hole cards is normally a winner, but in
Omaha it's often a loser. If you've done the work in the Rainy Day
chapter you'll have a good appreciation of the fact that suited
cards as high as suited kings are often behind to the holdings of
other players who have suited Aces in the same suit. That's the
nature of the Top 40 Omaha deal and you don't really appreciate
it unless (a) you've done the Rainy Day Exercise or (b) you've
given your stack away to nut flushes time and time and time again.

You know from the Rainy Day Exercise that King-flush holdings
are often behind, so don't even draw to low flushes.

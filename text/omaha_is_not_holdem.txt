OMAHA IS NOT HOLDEM

Last updated: 20200315

Because Omaha and Holdem are both flop games, they seem very similar.
Some of your Holdem skills (Reading the Board for example) transfer
100% to Omaha. But be warned. No Limit Holdem and Pot Limit Omaha
are very different games. Just about the only things they have 
in common is the Flop Game Structure.

The Flop Game Structure
=======================

  One or more blinds are posted so there is an initial pot to contest.
    Holdem normally has two blinds, Omaha sometimes uses a third blind.

  All players at the table are dealt unique hole cards. They keep these
    cards for the duration of the deal. They use these hole cards together
    with a certain number of the community cards to make their best
    five card poker hand at showdown, according to the showdown rules.

  Preflop Betting round. In any betting round, a player unwilling to
    match the bet must fold and surrender his cards and his chances of
    winning the pot. A player who has called with the last of his
    money is "all-in" and gets to showdown and contests the pot up to
    the amount of his bet matched by other active players. If there are
    no all-in players and someone bets and all other players fold, the
    hand finishes and the pot is awarded to the only active
    player. This happens a lot less in Omaha then in Holdem; you will
    see a lot more showdowns in Omaha.

Omaha Showdown Rule: 2+3
========================

In Texas you can use 2, 1 or even none of your hole cards in combination
with the 5 community cards to make your best 5 card poker hand. If you
use none of your hole cards, you're said to be "playing the board". If the
final community cards are AKQJT, no flush possible, then everyone still in the
hand has an unbeatable Ace-high straight (called "Broadway") and it
doesn't matter what anyone has as their hole cards, everyone still in
the hand will split the pot. Poker legend has it that in the 2005
World Series Main Event, four players were in a hand with this final
board. One player bet, the next player raised, two Internet qualifiers
folded and it ended up being a 2-way split not a 4-way split!

Besides the AKQJT community, there are some other very rare boards
which make for a guaranteed split. 2222A is a split and AKQJT all the
same suit is a split; everyone makes a royal flush! You won't see
these other boards very often, but you will see unsuited Broadway now
and then.

In Omaha you have to use 2 cards of your own and 3 from the Board, a
showdown rule I call 2+3. Two of yours plus Three from the board.
This changes the hands you can make.

In this chapter I'll show the two cards you're using from your holding
in square brackets, and the three board cards afterwards.

In Texas a board of KQJT4 rainbow has any player with an Ace having
the nut straight. In Omaha, you need both the Ace and another of
the cards K,Q,J,T to qualify. If you've got AK44, you play the
AK from your hand and the QJT from the board to make [AK]QJT.
Your other cards make a set of 444 but they don't form your best
poker hand. A player with AJJT also has the straight here, he
plays his AJ with the KQT from the board for [AJ]KQT. A third
player with AA99 doesn't have a straight here, his best hand is
[AA]KQJ.

In Texas a board of T8632 four Diamonds will often see the winner
holding a single high Diamond. In Omaha, you need 2 Diamonds of your
own to make the flush here. The fourth flush card on the board doesn't
change whether someone has a flush or not. If three hearts
come on the flop, nobody has a draw to a heart flush; they either have
the flush already (by having two hearts in their holding)
or they can't get one. In both Texas and Omaha, a flush is possible in
just one suit by the time all the cards are out.

More 2+3 confusion occurs with double-paired Boards. In Texas if I have
AK on a board of KK884 then I have a full house KKK88. But in Omaha
I don't - I have trip Kings. With a holding of AKQT and a board of 
KK884 my best hand is [AK]KK8 for KKKA8. Again, I'm showing the 2 cards
I must use from my holding I'm using in square brackets [] here.
Once I've used my two cards there's no room in the board 3 to 
include both those KK88 to fill up. There's only room for exactly
three board cards in my final Five Card Hand.

Another confusion from the 2+3 rule is when there's three of a kind on
the board. In Texas on a board of 222T8 you've got a full house with
either a T or an 8 in your holding. But in Omaha, you need a pocket
pair to make a full house, because the three cards from the board
you'll be using are the [xy]222. In a matchup of 6554 versus T987
on the 222T8 board, [55]222 beats [T9]222. Of course in either
Holdem format, someone with a single 2 for the quad [x2]222 is the winner.

Some players used to Texas showdowns sometimes try to play 
wide straights, 6-card straights don't help in Omaha. AKT6 looks like
you've got a straight on the board of J5432 but you can't play
the A6 and four middle cards to make a six card straight, you have
to make a 5-card poker hand. In the 2+3 Showdown, your best hand
is just [AK]J54 and you can't even beat a pair here. The widest gap
you can make a straight with is a 3-gapper; they are AT, K9, Q8,
J7, T6, 95, 84, 73, 62, 5A. Besides AT, the 3-gap hands are mostly
trash and you need more going for your hand before you start playing them.

DOCTOR STRAIGHT FACT: Years ago I played K9 to a big raise in
No Limit Holdem. The flop came QJT. I was rubbing my hands as I
called the re-re-raised all-in bet, and quickly gave my stack away
to the raiser's AK. Three gappers are bad in Holdem and they're also
bad in Omaha.

The 2+3 Showdown Rule takes a lot of getting used to. One of
the advantages an experienced Omaha player has against a Holdemite is
experience in 2+3 Board reading. The Holdemite misreads the board
a lot and ends up calling with full houses that aren't, flushes that
aren't and even straights that aren't. This is great for the Omaha
regular and very costly for the Holdemite.

If you're in a game where a Holdemite keeps making this mistake, stay
in that game. The Holdemite is giving away his money and you're a
great chance to pick up some of it, together with the other sharks at
the table.

Multiway hands
==============

The two cards that you use from your holding to make your best
Five-Card final hand can and do change after each board card. Consider
this holding: Ac9d9h4c. The flop is AJc4, at this stage you are using
your A4 and your best hand is [A4]A4J. Two pair Aces and Fours, Jack
kicker. The turn comes the 9 of clubs,
a great card for you, and now you use your 99 to make a trips hand,
[99]9AJ. Trip Nines, Ace-Jack kickers. The river comes the 3 of clubs,
making you the nut flush. You're now playing Ac4c again, not to make
two pairs, but for the Nut Flush. Hands that can change to better and
better hands are called Multiway hands and are prized hands in
Omaha. When you're looking at your holding preflop; have a think about
the kinds of hands it can make.

In this example my best hand climbed the poker ladder with each
new board card. I started with two pair on the flop, climbed up
to three of a kind on the turn and finished with a nut flush on the river.

If the river had been an Ace, then on the final board of AJ49A,
I would use the combination [A9] to make my best poker hand
(doesn't matter which of my Nines I'm using) for the hand [A9]AA9,
Aces full of 9sm the second nut hand that loses only to AJxy.
If the river had been a 4, for a final board of
AJ494, I would use my [99] combination for [99]944, Nines full 
of Fours, which loses only to AAxy or JJxy. If someone has J4xy they lose;
they make the full house [J4]J44 for 444JJ "fours full of Jacks" but I beat
them with [99]944 for "nines full of fours".

Most of the time in Flop Games, 
the nut hand changes with each board card produced.
On the flop, the nut hand might be top set and a good two pair
can be good enough. By the turn, the nut hand might be a straight,
and there are now flush possibilities (sometimes even flush chances
in two suits: if there are two clubs and two spades by the turn,
any black card on the river makes a flush possible). By the river,
the nut hand can be a full house (if the board is paired), a
flush, a straight or top set.

Occasionally in Flop Games a high-rung hand is possible right from the start.
If the flop is all one suit, a flush is already possible, and the only
climbing of the ladder will be to a full house, quads or a straight flush.
A flop with a pair on it means a full house or quads can already be there.

In Texas it pays to be aware of the Nut hand on every street
and in Omaha it's absolutely crucial that you track what
the Nut hand is, and whether you can make a nuttier hand after
the next board card. If you've got a chance of climbing to
a higher hand (either higher on the poker ladder or higher in rank)
you're said to have a "redraw" to a better hand.

Sometimes the flop is so co-ordinated (wet) that the
high value hands can be present from the start. A pair on the flop
means a full house could already be present. Three spades on the flop
means a flush could be out there already, no need to wait for the
turn or the river to make your flush. When there's big hands possible
already after the flop, you don't pay to draw to the lower rung hands.

Looking at your holding
=======================

You can see preflop, looking at your holding, the kinds of hands you
can make by the river. QcQJ4c can make a set of Queens, a Queen-high
club flush and a straight using the QJ (that straight might be 
Broadway, King high straight or Queen high straight depending on 
the board cards it's joining with).

This is actually a pretty poor Omaha holding and you can fold it preflop,
although I'd take a cheap flop with it just for the high
set value of the Queens. In Texas, QQ is a hand to get excited about, in
Omaha, QQJ4 is pretty average, maybe just on the playable side of OK.

Because the showdown rule is 2+3, you know even before seeing any 
community cards that you're going to have to use two of your own
cards in a showdown. So you can look at your holding 2 cards at a time,
and see how playable each 2 card combo is. With QQJ4 the combos
are QQ, QJ, Q4 and J4. With KJT9 the combos are KJ, KT, K9, JT, J9 and T9.
KJT9 has many more playable combos and is a better Omaha hand.

Ad8h7h6d: This holding can make the nut flush in diamonds, a straight flush
in hearts, a very low 8-high flush in hearts and a whole bunch of middle 
straights. I like this holding a lot. This is the PLO equivalent of
a good suited connector hand in NLH, while also adding that Nut flush
chance.

Jd742d: A real trash hand. There's not much chance of making straights
and if you do, you'll often lose to higher straights. If you're using
J7 to make a straight to T98, someone with QJ will have a better straight,
and QJ is much more playable than J7! That suited Jack is also
big trouble, low flushes lose to higher flushes in Omaha, and Jack-high
is very low for a flush. Looking at the two card combos there's none
that you'd play in Texas: J7, J4, J2suited, 74, 72, 42. There's 6 bad hands.
Fold it now. Six trash Holdem hands add up to a trash Omaha hand. TAHITM.

JT54: This is two OK Holdem hands and the other combinations are rubbish.
Here our combinations are JT (good), J5 (trash), J4 (trash), T5 (trash), 
T4 (trash) and 54 (ok if you spike exactly the right flop). I'll play this
sometimes if I feel really loose, much more often than J742, but this is
a speculative $3/$10 flop hand only.

When you've got a pocket pair, such as that A994 hand, you get fewer
unique combinations: A9, A9 again, A4, 99, 94, 94 again. So instead
of 6 combinations you've got 4, but one of those combinations is
a powerful pocket pair that can get you a big full house when you hit.

Sometimes you get three of a kind in your holding, which cuts
right down on your number of combinations and virtually kills off
your chances of flopping a set. You need the final card of that
rank on the board! KKK5 gives you the combinations KK and K5 only,
and just about no chance of finding that fourth and final King.
Fold it. Likewise three flush cards in your holding makes
it less likely you'll make a flush (your holding includes one of
your own outs) and four flush cards in your holding makes it
much less likely. Instead of 11 other suit cards to appear
on the board to make you your flush, there's now only 10 or 9.

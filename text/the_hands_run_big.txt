THE HANDS RUN BIG

Updated 20180814

"From time to time a very good hand,
 correctly played,
 will cost you your whole stack;
 that's just part of big-stack poker".

- Dan Harrington, in Harrington on Cash Games, Volume 1, page 82.


One of the first things to understand about Omaha 
and keep in your mind forever afterwards is that
the winning hand shown down is either the
Nuts or the second Nuts. The hands run big.

This means you've got to be very careful when you're betting or
calling with a strong but non-nut hand and
enemies in this pot are sticking around. You could be in a lot 
of trouble.

In Texas it's pretty rare for two both-hole-cards-used made
flushes to be in a contest together and almost unheard of for three 
flushes to be there. In Omaha this happens all the time. Thanks to
everyone having a 4-card holding, there's a lot more flushes out there.
This means you've got to be very careful with non-nut flushes in the
face of heavy betting. If you're the player lucky enough to have 
the nut flush, you can bet it strongly and expect more action than you'd
get in Texas, where players are unlikely to have a Flush themselves
and won't get heavily involved in the pot. Slow play and trapping
are much less factors in Omaha than they are in Texas.

The Top Forty principle
=======================

In Full Ring PLO, the top 40 cards of the deck are dealt to players.
That means that if the flop comes JJ3 it's very likely someone's got
the Jack, in fact it's highly likely that both the remaining Jacks
are in people's holdings. Because the top 40 cards of the deck
are dealt off, the next 4 cards (burn and three-card flop) contained
2 Jacks. The likelihood is strongest that both remaining Jacks are
in the players' holdings. There's not many "dead cards" at the bottom
of the deck, 40 of them have already been dealt to the player.

In Texas ten-handed only the top 20 cards are dealt to the players,
so on a flop of JJ3 you'll normally win with the Jack - there's a good
chance the case (4th and final) Jack is in the bottom 28
cards of the deck. But in PLO there's more of a chance that the 
fourth Jack was in the top 40 cards dealt to the 
players, not the unseen 9.

So if your holding is JT96 and the flop is JJ3, you're not automatically
the winner here. You've really got a draw to a full house, and if
there's someone else staying in the pot with you, he's got either
that fourth Jack or pocket 33. And if he's got the fourth Jack,
chances are excellent that he's got a higher kicker than your best
kicker the Ten. Let's say he's got AKJ9, you're currently behind
[JT]JJ3 to [AJ]JJ3. You really want to hit your full house, and
hope that he doesn't hit a bigger fullhouse. Sometimes your
opponent will have the 33 set for [33]3JJ, and be hoping that
you don't hit your 10-out better-full-house-or-quads draw 
(any T,9,6 or the case Jack).

Because of the Top Forty principle, most of the cards you see in
the Community are the case card of that rank. A lot of players
say "you were lucky on the river, that was the case Seven"
when the board pairs with a seven, but of course it was
because with one seven in your holding and one on the flop
the likelihood is that at least one of the two remaining sevens
was in the top 40 cards dealt. So when you see a repeater on
the river, it's likely to be the case card. On a flop of A75
you're often looking at the case Ace, the case Seven and
the case Five.

Adjusting to Nut hands
======================

Because winning hands in PLO are so Nutty, there's no point
staying in a pot with a non-nut draw that won't be the
guarenteed winner if it hits. I call these "Low Confidence
Hands" - they're not strong enough to bet with confidence so
when they do win it tends to be a small pot. And when you are
behind, the Low Confidence Hands can be tempting enough to
call with, so you can lose real money there as well. That's bad
either way.

You can't bet them with confidence, and you sometimes have to pay 
off that better hand with your made draw, just in case. 
The safest thing to do is to avoid difficult decisions by getting 
out early and not taking these non-nut chances. In Texas if I've got 98
on a JT5 flop I'll stay in and be happy if a Q or 7 comes
on the turn. In Omaha if I had 9877 to that JT5 flop I'll
fold to action very easily; even though in both cases I have
the same lower-end open ended straight draw, and in the Omaha
example I make my straight if a Q, 9, 8 or 7 comes. 
Too many times in Omaha you'll make a low straight and still lose.

In Texas, most of the winning hands are on the lower rungs
of the Poker Hands ladder. High card, One pair, two pair, trips,
straights, flushes and the very occasional full house. In Omaha
the hands are much higher: straights, flushes, full houses,
quads and straight flushes. The hands run big. I read somewhere
that the median winning Holdem hand is two pair: half of the
winning hands are higher than two pair, half are lower. For Omaha
the winning median hand is a straight: half the time the winner
is a flush, a full house or better.

With so many cards in the holdings of the players, the Nut
hand often changes with each board card and so does the betting lead.
On the flop, two pair or a set is often the best hand. If the turn
doesn't pair the board, a Straight is quite often the winner and
once the river comes out a Flush or a Full House often takes the lead.
The Australian stripped-deck limit card game Manila shows similar
swings in the best hand with each new board card produced. Manila
doesn't have a flop; it starts with 1 community card shown then
adds a 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th.. traditionally the dealer and most
of the players say "Last card Manila" before that 5th board card,
what we call the River, is shown. Manila has the same showdown
rules as Omaha: both your hole cards and three from the board.
It can be played with 3 starting cards; where you use 2 of your 3
and three board cards to make your best hand. 

Manila, especially 3-card Manila, has a fair bit in common with
Omaha, and some of the older generation of Manila players now play
Limit Omaha at Crown Casino; which is played Friday and Saturday
nights there at limits of 10/20 and sometimes 20/40 or even 30/60.
It's an expensive and cruel game, you can't bet people out of draws
because you can only bet $20 into a $160 pot; and you have to
keep chasing even on longshot draws because you're calling $20 to win
a $160 pot plus an extra bet on the end. I won't say more about
Limit Omaha in this book, I still love Limit Poker (harder and harder
to find these days) and I try to make a few trips to Melbourne
each year and play some FLO: Fixed Limit Omaha. Now that I've mentioned
Fixed Limit Omaha, I'll ignore it for the rest of the book.

Don't draw to a lower rung hand
===============================

A really good rule of thumb, which most players understand by
instinct, is not to pay to draw to a hand on the Poker Ladder when
a higher-rung hand is already possible. If the flop comes all Diamonds,
don't draw to a straight; the flush could already be out and you're
drawing dead. If there's a pair on the flop, don't draw to a flush
because a full house could already be out there and you're drawing dead.
On an unpaired but co-ordinated board (a "wet" board), Top Set can 
itself be a drawing hand - you're drawing to a full house or quads and
if the board doesn't pair it's almost impossible for your top set
to be good - you expect you'll lose to a Straight or Flush.

Redraws
=======

The really fantastic Omaha holdings have the ability to have the
best hand on each phase of the Community, with redraws to even
better hands. Here's one of my actual hands that illustrates
this concept fully. I have AKsQsQ; the flop comes JsTs5. While
at the moment my hand is just a pair of Queens, I've got a lot
of straight outs (all of them Nut) and outs to the King-high flush
plus two of those flush outs make me the Straight Flush. Let
me count my straight outs: 3 Aces (I play KQ), 3 Kings (I play AQ),
2 Queens (I play AK) and 4 Nines (I play KQ). So that's 12 outs
to a straight (this is normally a 13-card Nut wrap but I have
two of the Queens so in my case it's a 12-card wrap).

The turn comes a Red Queen. I've now got my nut straight, [AK]QJT
and also top set QQQ with it; giving me full house and quad
chances on the river. If I was up against a two-pair hand like
JT then he can now no longer beat me on the river by the 
board pairing.

The money goes all in on this street, the river comes a red 9 and
my AK Broadway straight is good enough to scoop the money.
Unless the Ace-high flush draw was out there, or someone
had trips with a one-out chance of quads, there was no river card
that could beat me.

My main danger on the river was for an Ace or King to
arrive and make a split pot with other people also making Broadway.

Big straight draws are called Wraps and run so big that they can
be a favourite on the flop against Top Set! Consider QJT8 on the
flop K97, up against AKK4. The straight gets there is a 6,8,T,J or Queen
arrives: 16 winners whereas the top set has 7 outs on the turn and
10 on the river.

Omaaaagh hands
==============
Now and then you get two players shoving all their chips in on
a flop and it's a big hand confrontation with no big favourite and both
players are playing the hand well. Top set against straight wrap is
one you'll see a lot of; if the straigt wrap has flush chances to he
becomes the favourite.

I call these big Omaha hands "Omaaaagh" hands because it combines the word
Omaha with the word AAAAGH which is what you say when you lose
your stack with them because the Card Gods didn't do it for you
on this runout. The word also sounds and spells a bit like OMG
which is what you say when you see the strength of the other
player's draw. These Omaaaagh hands are where a lot of the variance
comes into PLO: you'll win or lose hundreds of dollars on this hand.
I hope the Card Gods are with you.

Because good players don't chase straights and flushes once
the board is paired, it can be hard to make big money from your
Top Set once it's become a Full House with the board pairing.
Top Set normally jams the flop both to make money when he fills
up and also to protect his hand against the multitude of possible draws.
With pot limit betting, the maximum bet on the flop might not
be big enough to chase the good draws away and the really good
draws as we saw above can actually be the favourite to win. Jamming
your top set and getting outdrawn is common in PLO, but you're
still correct to jam your top set when it's the current Nuts.

If your flopped sets get outdrawn over and over again you'll feel like
you're going mad, as you go further and further broke. Sometimes
the Omaha Card Gods are much crueller than their Texas cousins.

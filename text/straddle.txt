STRADDLES

Last updated: 20190129

A straddle is a "no-look" raise put in by the Under-the-Gun player
(first to act preflop) at Blinds posting time, to make the pot
bigger and stimulate some action. Because the Blinds are $1/$3,
the maximum amount to raise to is $10. The Straddle can be
any amount between $6 (min raise) and $10 (full pot raise).
Most straddlers chose $6, a few go for $10, almost nobody
straddles to $7, $8 or $9.

If there's extra posts in the hand (from first-hand players
or returning players making up for missed blinds or both) then the
straddle can be even higher. In practice, the straddler normally
goes to either $6 or $10. The extra money from extra posters comes
into play with the first player raising the pot; who gets to
go a bit higher than he normally would.

The Accidental Two Chip Raise to $10
------------------------------------
If the straddle is $6, an interesting application of the
Casino's "2 chips is a raise" rule comes into play. For future
players, it's $6 to call, raised from $3, but if they toss in
two $5 chips to call (because they're short of $1 chips) then
it counts as yet another raise, from $6 to $10. Remember
the straddle itself was a raise from $3 to $6, so the betting
on this round is small blind $1, big blind $3, raise to $6,
min re-raise = $6 + another $3 = $9, so $10 chucked out in two
chips without any verbal announcement counts as a min-plus-a-bit 
reraise to $10.

This is why I always say "call Six" - there's no ambiguity in what I'm doing.
For the quiet players at the table, another way to show they're calling
not raising is to put the first $5 chip in and then the second $5 chip
a moment later in a second motion. The casino is hot against string
betting, so this two-motion action is rightly considered a call.

If a poster (like small blind, big blind, first-hand player
or returning-to-table-missed-some-blinds player)
has a $5 chip out as their $3 post and tosses a second $5 chip
out, this is a single-chip throwout and counts as a call of $6,
not a raise to 10. A single-chip throw without verbal announcement
counts as a call.

I've found that if you're in the first few callers after a straddle
and there's a hand you'd like to get your whole stack in with and
hopefully get one-on-one with someone, then a dinky two-chip
throwout "accidental" raise to $10 works really well. There's a 
better than usual chance a player behind you will re-raise pot, 
even the $6 straddler himself, and then
you can re-pot again and really shove a lot in preflop and
get most of the other players to fold. Sure, sometimes you try
this and the remaining action is a few folds and everyone else
calling the $10 and you end up six players to a flop with a pot
of $60, but sometimes there'll be that re-raise for you and you
can shut out the field with another big raise on top.

Here's an example. Seat 10 has the Button.
UTG is Seat 3 and I'm in Seat 5. I've got AAKT, double suited, and
this is a hand I'd like to take to war one-on-one for my stack, which
is $210. Last hand I missed a big draw which I paid $30 for on the flop
and $90 for on the turn, so I'm a bit annoyed that my $340 stack is now
$210 and I'd like some instant justice.

 9 (CO)	  fold to call of 10
 10 (Bn)  Call 10. PB=56		Fold to call of 210 (-10)
 1 (sb)   "Raise pot" to 75, PB=126	Call 210,147 more. PB=473
 2 (bb)   Fold to call of 75 (-3) 

Remember to read the betting actions top to bottom, first in the
"First action" column, then the "Second action" column, starting
with Seat 4 facing the call of that $6 straddle. My "whoops" is
the two $5 chip throwout "accidental raise". In this hand the small blind
had KQQJ - a very powerful PLO hand, but one that matches poorly against
my AAKT. We're "off to the races" and the runout and result don't
matter that much, the important thing is that I've managed
to engineer the desired result of playing for all my chips against
just one opponent, maximising my chances for a double up.

If you really must know, my AAKT held up easily on the runout.

Even when I don't get that pot re-raise of my $10 "accidental" raise,
and everyone simply calls the $10 or folds, and there's six players
to the flop with a pot size at $60, this is a good outcome for me. 
I've built up the pot to $60 at a cost to me of just $10. 

If I hit the flop super hard, with AAKT can
certainly do, I can get big money in as an
almost-sure-thing favourite, and when I miss the flop (which
AAKT can also certainly do, any Omaha holding can miss the flop)
then I'll slow right down and fold to substantial action.

Should you straddle?
--------------------

I don't straddle that much myself; unless I'm in a winning big or
losing big situation. Straddling increases the variance in Omaha,
which is already a massively high variance game. The game is wild
enough as it is without paying $10 to $55 for every flop.

Some of the straddler are Five-Five Refugees who are bringing the
stakes and pot sizes up to the level they normally see in that game,
which takes the 1/3 regulars out of their comfort zone which helps
the Five-Five Refugees.

I almost never agree to a deal where every under-the-gun player
straddles, unless the game is really short handed, four players
or less.

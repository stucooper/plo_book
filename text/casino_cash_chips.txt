CASINO CASH CHIPS

Updated: 20250128

"Whoever invented gambling was smart,
 whoever invented chips was a genius" - Old Poker Saying.

The Star uses chips in the following familiar denominations:
$1 (blue), $5 (red), $25 (green), $100 (black) and $1000 (orange).
The chips are all the same size except for the Orange chip which
is substantially larger. There's even bigger chips, such as a yellow
$5000 chip, but you shouldn't come across any of those playing 1/3.

The biggest thing I've ever seen was an individually numbered 
Ivory plaque to the value of $25,000. It wasn't in play. I think
a gold bar of that size and weight wouldn't be worth as much.

There's a $2.50 table games chip that can't be used at the poker
tables. Very occasionally someone uses one as their Card Protector.

Blackjack and Roulette use $10 blue chips as well as these other
chips, and sometimes a player arrives with a few $10 chips. They
don't sell them at the poker area chip buyin desk, and they
look a fair bit like the $1 chips, they're both light blue. People
can bring them from other table games and use them in the poker
games. The regular players and the dealers dislike the $10 chips
and the dealer will often change a new player's stash of $10 chips
into the more convenient $5 chips instead. 

A player arriving with $10 blue chips has been playing Blackjack
or Roulette for a while and hasn't been a winner, and is now trying
for a quick get-even at PLO. He'll bust this buyin in 3 or 4 hands
and go home completely broke. There's not much easy money to be
made from these players, expect them to lose their first and only
buyin and simply leave the game. Hopefully you get a good holding in
the next 5 hands and can win the small stack from the table games player
without too much risk.

Announce your bets: action and number
=====================================

Most players (just about everyone at the table apart from me it seems)
try to call, bet and raise as silently as possible. They'll bet
a mystery amount of red chips and force the dealer to count it
and announce the bet to the other players at the table. They'll raise
or check-raise in a similar silent fashion. I always announce what
I'm doing and the amount of my call, bet or raise. "Call fifteen.
Raise to 40 total. Fold".

Australia's greatest cricketer, Don Bradman, used to scream
"No!" from the non-strikers end to play-and-miss deliveries
easily gloved by the wicketkeeper that were never a chance
for a quick single. He was always on the lookout
for easy runs and kept bonus Byes very much an option in his
running between the wickets.

By always saying my intention and the number involved, I've cut down
my betting errors to zero a year. Most players
I've seen make one or two per month. By always announcing your bets,
you can tidy up your occasional betting mistakes too. Sure you might
be giving away vocal tells in the tone of your voice but the more
you talk, the better at it you get.

You probably already know that, facing a bet, a single chip throwout
without verbal announcement functions as a call. If you say the
word "raise" before the chip hits the felt, you've raised to the value
of that chip or you've raised to the size of the pot, whichever is lower,
provided that you've put in enough chips to be a full raise.

Two or more chips thrown out is a raise to that value, or the
biggest allowed bet. We'll see an
interesting preflop application of this rule in 1/3 games with
a $6 straddle, see the "Straddles" chapter for the full story.

If you're facing a call of $46 and you put in a black $100 chip 
and $6 in loose chips you're obviously calling the $46 and making 
the change easier for the dealer by adding the extra $6,
but if you chuck in 2 black chips that's clearly a raise to $200 or
the biggest allowed bet.

I never make errors in the amounts of my bets, because I say a number,
but I sometimes make out-of-turn errors. It doesn't matter much
if I make a "call 15" error with a player still to act before me,
but if I want to raise the pot I have to make totally sure that
I'm not acting out of turn and that my pot raise will stand.

I make 100% sure that I have the dealer's attention and doubly sure
that action's on me and that I'm not acting out of turn. I often
ask the question "Is it on me? Yes?? OK, I raise the pot".

Buying Chips
============

At The Star there's a dedicated chip buyin desk. You can't buy
from the dealer, you can sometimes sneak-buy (under the table)
from other players if they have chips in their pocket for
their own rebuys that they don't need right now. Sometimes
the chip buyin desk has a 5 person queue or is unattended.
When this happens, I buy $25 and $100 chips at a Blackjack
table. If there's people playing I say "Good luck, players"
and return with my chips to the Poker area.

I normally buy $300 worth of chips at the buyin desk in the following
way: "Hundred in reds, hundred in greens and a black". This gives
me 20 x $5 chips, 4 x $25 chips and 1 x $100 chip. I use the
reds and two of the greens for a $150 buyin, with 2 more greens
and the black in my pocket for a $150 rebuy if the first buyin
goes bust. If I lose both buyins, it's back to the buyin desk
for the same procedure, giving me two more $150 buyins. If there's
plenty of red chips at the table, I'll go for a quick rebuy
of two blacks four greens for my $300, if I think I won't
easily be able to change my black chip I'll get another red tower
from the buyin desk and repeat the "hundred in reds, hundred in greens
and a black" of my first buyin.

A few players hate the $25 green chips but I really like them.
They make bet sizing very easy compared to a stack of red chips
that could be a $55,$60,$65 or $70 bet.

Some players have a handbag or shoulder bag or bum bag with their
extra chips in them. A few of the bigger players keep a $1000 chip
in their pocket, which they can change at the table, normally
these players will buy in for the full $300 and pocket 7 black
chips for further rebuys. 

I've thought long and hard over a long, long time about the
amount of my buyin and how much to buy from the buyin desk
at each visit. I like my buyin strategy a lot and genuinely
believe that it contributes to my wins. I like the look
of those shoulder bags, they could also carry my
writing notepad and spare pens. I'll buy one and add
it to my poker equipment.

The $100 Frisbee-Chip tell
==========================

A lot of the tells in Mike Caro's Book of Poker Tells
involve how bettors handle their chips. One tell that
I've noticed in the Star 1/3 PLO game is players
will casually toss in a $100 chip on the turn or river round.
They frisbee it in so it lands from a height of 10 centimetres or so.
They almost splash the pot with it, they don't carefully
place it in their normal betting area.

This is a carefree "oooh I'm tossing this black chip in,
I really don't care about it" act, and belongs in the
class of "Weak means Strong" tells. Unless you've got a nutty
hand, or a strong draw to a winner, don't call this $100 bet.

I've found myself doing the same thing when I'm nut peddling
a hand on the river and hoping to get someone to call for $100.
Rather than nonchalantly tossing in the chip, and giving off exactly
this tell, I'd be better off pushing out a Red tower along the 
table felt and betting in the usual way.

Players sometimes call on the river with this casual frisbee; this
isn't really a tell; the calling player has a good enough hand to
call with (which is common in PLO) but not nut enough to raise with
(again, common in PLO). The frisbee-chip throw is a tell from the
bettor; not from the caller.

Colouring Up and Cashing Out
============================

The buyin desk has plenty of plastic racks that have five
columns that each hold 20 chips for 100 chips total. Each full column of
red $5 chips is $100. Get one of the racks from the buyin desk,
take it to your table and use it to carry your cashout chips.

The chip buyin desk will colour-change your chips up to $1000, $100
and $25 chips, which you then have to take to the main cashier to turn
into cash, beautiful cash. A full rack of red chips is $500, the buyin
desk staff will carefully check each row has the full 20 chips in it.

If you've got 20-high stacks of red chips, offer to colour-change
$100 chips for other players at your table as you're leaving.
A few players might have recently re-bought and have some $100 chips
that are hard to properly size bets with, also some players like
having masses of towers and lots of physical chips rather than a
few big value ones (I'm a bit like this myself, if I've got
$600 as three red towers and three blacks and someone's leaving
I'll sometimes turn my blacks into even more red towers).

The dealer will usually change your $1 chips into $5 chips,
if you have more than five $1 chips. Dealers like having $1
chips in their tray to give preflop change with. The dealer won't do
$5 or $25 colour ups, you'll need the other players to do that
and if they don't want to, use the buyin desk.

I like to sneak a photo of my chips before cashing out.
Photography is frowned on in the casino itself, so I'll
sneak to the outdoor smoking area and quickly snap a picture
of the chips, then I'll take them to the cashier and turn them
into cash.

The main cashier staff will pay you out in $100 notes unless
you specify otherwise. $100 notes can be tricky to spend, so I'll
sometimes ask for part of the money to be paid in $50s and the rest
in $100s. If I've got too many $100 notes at home I'll go and bank
some, which is always a great feeling. Normally I keep about
$2000 in $100 bills at home as my playing bankroll, this is
enough to suffer two losing sessions in a row without
having to hit the ATM.

FLOP PLAY

Last updated: 20180703

In Holdem you normally "play it or dump it" on the Preflop Betting
Round. In Omaha you'll be taking a lot more flops, and your
"play it or dump it" decision often comes once you've seen the flop.
There's still plenty of hands that you'll dump preflop, and a 
good preflop fold of a Trouble Holding can save you your stack, 
but a lot of the time you and plenty of other people will be taking
a flop. In 1/3 PLO you get a lot of flops with 7 players having
paid $3 to see a flop, or 6 players having paid $10 to see a flop.

Hit, Fit or Fold
----------------

You've got to connect with the flop so strongly in Omaha. Overpairs
aren't the winners that they are in Holdem. If someone bets the pot
and you're wondering what to do, ask yourself this question:
"Can I beat middle set by the turn?". If you've got good outs
to a hand that can beat middle set, call the bet, otherwise
fold and wait for the next hand. If you've got middle set
or top set yourself, strongly consider a big raise. You
could be up against a lower set who is scared of draws and
might jam his stack in right now when he's no chance of winning.
This is a fantastic result for you because it should wipe out
any naked straight or flush draws that might actually beat you
in the runout.

In Holdem you might ask yourself on the flop "Can I beat 
Top Pair/Top Kicker on the next card?" in the face of a strong 
flop bet, but in Omaha the hands are so strong that the question 
to ask yourself is "Can I beat middle set by the turn?".

This question helps you play flush draws, straight draws and
two pair flops well. If you've flopped top and bottom pair, or
bottom two, you can't beat a flopped middle set by the turn
unless the top pair repeats.

When you looked at your holding preflop and you decided to play,
you should have a good idea what a good flop for you would be.
If you're playing QQJ8 a good flop would be QT5 or T94. If you've
got a suited Ace a good flop would have two more cards of that suit,
giving you a nut flush draw. 

If you don't flop the cards that you'd hoped for, don't continue 
in the hand. Another hand will be along in two minutes (TAHITM), let 
other players fight it out for this pot.

Top two pair
------------

If you've flopped top two pair, you might be ahead and you can consider
taking down the pot right now if you can. The ranks of the top two pair
are important. KJ on a KJ5 flop is better than A7 on A76. The KJ top two
is likely to stay the top two on the turn, the A7 is likely to not be the
top two cards in rank when the turn comes. KJ only loses its top two pair
status if an Ace or a Queen turns, whereas A7 can be outdrawn if the turn
is a K,Q,J,T,9 or 8. 

Flopping top two pair in Omaha is like flopping Top Pair/Top Kicker
in Holdem. It's a good hand, and it'll often win the pot as it is,
but if players stick around and big money piles into the pot, it's
got little chance of winning. In Holdem some great advice is
"don't go broke with one pair", in PLO I suggest you "don't go broke
with two pair".

Have a look how wet or dry the flop is. Since straight wraps are
so big in Omaha you need a widely separated flop to be convinced
there's no good straight draws (9 outs or better) out there. There
are very few wide flops in Omaha; K72, K82, K83, and Q72 are about
the only ones.

If the top two cards get too close (K9, Q8) you start to get
inner wrap chances, the same as if the lower two cards are 62 or 52.

You can push two pair strongly when you have a short stack, it's a good
enough holding to get your money in with. This is like Holdem if you
have a $70 stack on a $50 pot and you hold KJ on a flop of JT8. You might
as well go all-in and you'll often get called by T9 and a lot of the
time you'll double up. But if you've got a $200 stack you have to play
it a lot more carefully.

Flop texture
============

If there's plenty of players taking a flop, there's a few flop types
that will make one player the immediate strong favourite.

Paired flops
------------

On a T66 flop, whoever has a 6 will be hot favourite (it's easy for
him to fill up, if he's not already got a full house) and sometimes
there's two players each with a 6 (remember the Top Forty principal:
the likelihood is that both the unknown Sixes are in the holdings)

When this happens, you normally see a 80% pot sized bet from one player
and a single caller. The betting often slows down until one of the
players gets a full house (either on the turn or the river) and then
betting comes alive again.

Sometimes there's a third player in and there's big bets and calls
on each of the flop, turn and river streets. This normally means
that someone has flopped the Overfull with TT, and two other players
holding a 6 are making crying calls trying to hit their full house
when they're actually drawing dead. This is a fantastic result
for the player with the overfull and sometimes he'll pick up the
stacks of two other players, with no risk whatsoever.

Flush flops
-----------

If the flop comes all of one suit, chances are good that one and possibly
two players have each flopped the flush. Fold your straight chances,
they won't win this hand. Often there's not much betting but one of
the players has flopped a small flush: not enough to bet with but
easily good enough to check/call with on the river if the pot is kept
small. A flopped non-nut flush is a small pot hand in PLO.

If you flop a set on a flush flop, try to draw cheaply and fill up.
Take free or cheap cards if you can get them - you'll run the risk
of losing to a lucky straight playing this way who would've folded
had you bet, but if you start betting your sets regularly you'll
just be giving your chips away on those times when the made flush
is out there (and it usually is, trust me). A set on a flush
draw is really a 7 out draw to a full house on the flop and
a 10 out draw to a full house on the turn. 

If you've flopped the nut flush yourself, bet it strong to get the
luckbox two pair draws out (or charge them the maximum) and get
lots of money from any smaller flushes out there. Sometimes you'll
pick up the small flop on the pot and you'll be disappointed that
you didn't get action. But when that happens, you wouldn't have
got any action later in the hand anyhow.. the best that could happen
is you get one crying call from a made straight by the river and if
the board pairs you have to slow down in case someone's Luckboated
you for free. Just bet it right now.

It sounds weird but pot-betting your nut flush is sneakier and more
deceptive than checking it or going for a check-raise. The hands
that will give you action (smaller flushes, sets) might think you're
"trying to buy it" and call you or even raise you. They might
reason that the nut flush might be played softer in case you risk
losing your customers. In Omaha you've got to do your own betting
and it's better to blast off customers than it is to string them
along and win the same small pot when they miss. It's also better
for your image; other players at the table see you putting in big
bets on scary flops and they know you're fearless.

In Holdem you're sometimes afraid of losing your customers when
you put bets in on the flop, so slow-playing is much more of a feature
of that game. In Omaha you're rarely that far ahead that you
can afford to slowplay, it's so easy to have a 2 pair hand in Omaha
on the flop that if you give free cards and the board pairs you've
cost youself badly. Had you bet the flop on an obvious made flush,
the two-pair, four-out hand would've folded, but now you've cost
yourself the pot and maybe more of your stack.

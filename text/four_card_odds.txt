FOUR CARD HOLDING ODDS

Last updated: 20181117

I have a Maths degree as well as a Computer Science degree and
while my day job is in Computers, I retain an interest and
skill in Maths. This chapter is about some maths and probability as it
applies to Poker and especially to Omaha.

The maths field this comes from is Combinatorics, which is a fancy
word meaning the science of combinations. It comes from the
field of Maths called Discrete Mathematics, the mathematics
of numbers and normal quantities, which is a separate field
to Calculus, the maths of the infinitessimally small.

Four card holdings
==================

When you get a four card holding it can arrive in 24 different ways.
If you've got AT73 all clubs you can arrange them left to right in
all of these different ways:

AT73      TA73          7AT3         3AT7
AT37      TA37          7A3T         3A7T
A7T3      T7A3          7TA3         3TA7
A73T      T73A          7T3A         3T7A
A3T7      T3A7          73AT         37AT
A37T      T37A          73TA         37TA

If you're betting on a horserace and you're convinced that
horses 1,3,7 and 10 will be the first four home but
you don't know the order, it takes 24 combinations to "box"
them in a First Four Bet. One of your four horses will come first,
then one of the remaining three will come second, then
one of the remaining two will come third, then
your last remaining horse will come fourth. If
you imagine A as "horse number 1" and T as "horse number ten"
then you can see my 24 combinations above cover all the
finishing chances for the four horses. 4x3x2x1=24.

For a Trifecta, your horses can arrive in 3x2x1 = 6 ways.

Because the order of your four card holding isn't important and
can be arranged in 24 different ways, the number of unique
Omaha holdings is (52x51x50x49)/24 = 270,725. There are
over two hundred and seventy thousand different four-card
combinations you can be dealt in Omaha.

Number of Badugi holdings: (abcd)
 = (52x39x26x13)/24
 = 28561.

This is worked out as follows: the first card you peek at can be anything,
it's a Diamond. The next card you peek at has to be one of the three
other suits, there's 39 of them. So 52x39 choices for the first two cards.
The third card has to be one of the remaining two suits (26 of them)
and the fourth card one of the fourth and final suit (13 of those).
So there are 28561 Badugi holdings, which is 10.5% of the 270,725
total holdings. So 9 times out of 10, your hand will have at
least two of a suit.

The Badugi holdings calculation, done by hand, cancels
out to 13x13x13x13. This makes sense because in a Badugi
holding you must have one club (pick one of 13) one spade
(pick one of 13) one heart (pick one of 13) and one diamond
(pick one of 13) and the number of ways of doing that
is 13x13x13x13. Sometimes when working out these probabilities
you come up with an answer that can be arrived at in
a mathematical way and a different, more intuituve way.
13x13x13x13 is a more intuitive way.

The turnboard is another random four card combination so these
probabilites apply to it as well. The turnboard will have no flush
chances only 10% of the time. 9 times out of 10, a flush draw will
be possible on the turn. 1 in 7 times, a flush draw will be possible
in two suits.

Number of all-cards-same-suit holdings: (aaaa)
 = (52x12x11x10)/24
 = 2,860

Number of three-of-a-suit, one offsuit holdings
 = 4 x number of ways of picking 3 cards from a suit x 39 (offsuit cards)
 = 4 x (13x12x11)/6 x 39
 = 4 x 286 x 39
 = 44,616

Number of double-suit holdings: (aabb)
  = number of two-of-a suit
     x number of two-of-a suit
     x number of suitpairs

  To get two-of-a suit, you can do that in (13x12)/2 ways, 78 ways.

  Now the number of suitpairs is 6:
  Hearts/Diamonds, Hearts/Clubs, Hearts/Spades
  Diamonds/Clubs,  Diamonds/Spades, Clubs/Spades

  So the number of double suit holdings
  = 78 x 78 x 6
  = 36,504

It's odd that there's less double-suited holdings than three-to-a-suit
holdings. This is because the double-suited holdings are "tight",
there's no room for extra cards. With the three-to-a-suit holdings,
there's a fourth offsuit card that can be any of 39 fourth cards.
So there are 39 Ac5c2c triple suited holdings, because the fourth
card can be any heart, diamond or spade.

Number of two-of-a-suit holdings: (aabc)
  = 4 suits x number of ways of two-of-a-suit
    x number of ways of other two cards being offsuit

  We know already the number of ways of getting two-of-a suit
  is 78. The number of ways of getting the two offsuit cards
  is (39 x 26)/2; the first offsuit card has to be one of three offsuits
  and the final offsuit card has to be one of two offsuit, different
  from the first offsuit. We divide by 2 because order is unimportant.
  If our suited cards are hearts, our offsuit cards might be
  the 5 of clubs and the 8 of diamonds.

So number of aabc hands
  = 4 x 78 x 39 x 13
  = 158,184

Here in a single table are the results of four-card holdings by suitedness:

Name     Type     Combinations  Percentage   Frequency
4-suit   aaaa          2,820       1.06%       1 in 100
3-suit   aaab         44,616      16.48%       1 in 6
2-suits  aabb         36,504      13.48&       1 in 7
1-suit   aabc        158,154      58.43%       3 in 5
Badugi   abcd         28,561      10.54%       1 in 10
TOTALS               270,725      99.99%

The percentages add up to just under 100.00% because I've rounded
each percentage to two decimal places. 58.43% is closer to 60%
than 50% so I've put its frequency as "3 in 5" not "1 in 2".

Number of quad holdings = (52x3x2x1)/24 = 13. This is another
result that doesn't need fancy multiplication and division,
there are so few four card quad holdings you can list them:
2222,3333,4444,5555,6666,7777,8888,9999,TTTT,JJJJ,QQQQ,KKKK,AAAA;
there they all are, there's 13 of them.

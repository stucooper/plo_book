SHOWDOWNS

Last updated: 20200602

Showdowns are a lot different in Omaha than they are in Holdem and
some words on Omaha showdowns are necessary in this book.

In Holdem it's pretty quick to see that the winning player has the
hand that beats you. He doesn't have to call his hand (cards speak),
he just has to show you both of his cards and you can see that yes, he
had the flush, or yes he has you outkicked. There's a few tricky ones
like AJ on an A77T34 board where it's worth being entirely sure that
the kicker plays (here it does, he's playing A77JT) but normally when
you call and see that the other player has you beat, you can fold your
losing hand unshown.

In Holdem the main showdown sin is slowrolling. The first player shows
what looks like the winner; the second player says "nice hand, you win"
takes his time showing his cards...holds onto them... looks disappointed..
and then finally shows an even better hand that takes the pot. This poor
behaviour is designed to add to the pain of losing the pot to the loser,
who has thought for a few seconds that he's the winner.

The next Holdem showdown sin is slowcalling. You bet all-in on the river,
a player thinks about it for half a minute and seems to be agonising over
what your hand might be, he wastes thirty seconds of playing time and
then calls with the absolute nuts or a very strong hand that was always
calling just on hand strength alone. In a cash game this needless
stalling is an annoying waste of time, in a Tournament it's unforgiveable
because a minute of your current level has been wasted and you'll get
at least one less hand at this blind level before they go up again.

A third showdown sin in Holdem is information asking. The called player
has to show first. Sometimes he asks the caller all kinds of things
about his hand "Do you have the flush? Can you beat two pair??" as if
inviting the caller to show _his_ hand first. I've seen called players
do this even though they hold the unbeatable Nuts.. they'll say
"Do you have the flush?" and you show a Queen high flush and think you're
the winner and they _still_ show the Ace high flush to you.

Poker is an Information War and the first player at Showdown has no right
to information on the caller's hand. If the caller loses, he has the
right to fold face down and surrender the pot. If the caller wins, he
needs to reveal his own hand and show a higher poker hand at Showdown.

It sounds simple (and it is) but poker players worldwide just have to
behave stupidly at showdown and do all kinds of Showdown Shenanigans.
It's so annoying, it's getting my temperature up just writing about it
here, but it's a part of poker and you need to deal with it. And just like
Omaha is much more complex than Holdem, Omaha showdowns are much more complex
than Holdem and there's some crazy showdown behaviour unique to Omaha.

This happens a little bit in Holdem as well.. there's a four flush
on the board, a player gets called and he shows just one of his cards,
the flush card winner. He has to show both of his cards at showdown,
the calling player has the right to see both of his hole cards. Some
strict games will consider a one card show followed by a muck to be
a fold and will award the pot to the calling player; most dealers and
supervisors will give a warning to the one-card shower and not let
him do it again that session.

In Omaha, the called player has to show his four card holding, and if
he's got an obvious winner it's polite for him to call his hand and show
which two cards he's using for his showdown hand. Poker being the
Information War, some called players like to show just the two cards they're
using and keep their other two cards private.

At Star, it works like this. Play is now stalled, and the called player
hopes that the calling player will also show. If the calling player wants
to see the called player's hand, the _calling_ player now has to reveal
his four cards. If, and only if, he does that, the called player will
now reveal the rest of his hand and now he has correctly shown down a hand
and can claim the pot.
 
I'll list the procedure as it should work, and how, sadly it often works

How it should work:
1) Nutster bets
2) Station calls
3) Nutster shows all four of his cards, revealing the Nut flush
4) Station folds, unseen. Nutster wins the pot.

How it often works:
1) Nutster bets
2) Station calls
3) Nutster shows two suited cards to the Ace, revealing he has a nut flush.
   Nutster hasn't shown his whole hand yet, but everyone at the table can
   see that Nutster has the Nuts and will win the pot. If Station wants
   to see the other two cards in Nutster's hand, Station has to reveal his
   hand as well.
4a) If Station folds, Nutster wins the pot without having to reveal his other
   two cards. Anyone who wants to know what kinds of hands Nutster enters
   the pot with or whether he had straight draws or a high pair along with
   his suited cards, is left none the wiser.
4b) If Station reveals his four-card holding, Nutster will now show his other
   two cards and win with his unbeatable Nut flush. Nutster has got to
   see Station's holding as well; even though he was the called player.

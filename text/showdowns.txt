SHOWDOWNS

Last updated: 20200602

Showdowns are a lot different in Omaha than they are in Holdem and
some words on Omaha showdowns are necessary in this book.

In Holdem it's pretty quick to see that the winning player has the
hand that beats you. He doesn't have to call his hand, he just has to
show you both of his cards and you can see that yes, he had the flush,
or yes he has you outkicked. There's a few tricky ones like AJ on an
A77T34 board where it's worth being entirely sure that his kicker plays
(here it does, he's playing A77JT) but normally when you call and
see that the other player has you beat, you can fold your losing hand
unshown.

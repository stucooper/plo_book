THE LEAVING DECISION

Last updated: 20181128

Cash poker has an important element that Tourment Poker doesn't,
the Leaving Decision. In a tournament you have to play until you bust, or
you're the Last Man Standing. In Cash you can leave at any time, and
unless you're playing in the dead hours of the morning and the game
is about to stop, the game simply goes on without you after you leave.

From your point of view, the game is over once you leave it.
There's poker games going on 24x7, the only one you really care about
is the one you're playing in. You might glance at a mate playing
on the other table, or watch a big all-in pot on it when
the players there are making a bit of noise, but the game you
care about is your own.

The leaving decision is the most important decision you'll make in Cash
Poker. If I wrote about aspects of poker proportional to how important
they were to your winnings, there'd be 70% of the book about your
leaving decision and 30% PLO playing advice. Instead you're getting
90% PLO playing advice, 5% live Casino advice and 5% Leaving Decision
advice. Sorry about that. I'd love to bang on and on about how important
leaving at the right time is but it would just get repetitive.
Trust me, the leaving decision is the most important thing in cash poker.

This is an area of my game that needs a lot of improvement, and it's
also an area of the game that differs a lot between people.
We're all unique people; we've got different incomes, different
bankrolls and different personalities and risk profiles. A $600
loss to you will feel very different than it does to me. I don't have
all the answers to making the best leaving decision, but I'll write
some guidelines and give you a framework that you can use to develop
a system that works for you.

I'm going to shout it out one more time.

THE MOST PROFITABLE SINGLE CHANGE EXPERIENCED CASH GAME
PLAYERS CAN MAKE IS IMPROVING THEIR LEAVING DECISION

Your next 100 sessions
======================

In the next few months you'll play 100 sessions of poker. I average
5 sessions a fornight, 12 a month so I'll probably have 100 sessions
done in the next 8 months. It might take you a year to play 100 sessions
or only 5 months, that's not important right now.

No matter how good you are, many of those 100 sessions will be losing
sessions. Let's say that 30 of your 100 sessions will be losers (and
that number's on the low side I think). Around a third of your sessions
you'll come out behind. Sometimes you'll win five sessions running and
you'll feel like the King of Poker, sometimes you'll lose three out of four
sessions and have a very expensive time of things.

After those hundred sessions you'll be up or down a certain amount.
Let's say you're up $6000. Nice play. Of course you wish you'd won
even more. The best way to have won more money is for your losing
sessions to be smaller.

If each one of your 30 losing sessions was one $150 buyin less,
you'd be up another $4500. Instead of being up $6000, you'd be up
$10500. Whatever your winning number was after those 100 sessions,
an extra $4500 would be noticed. You could be up $20000 and
that extra $4500 would still be significant.

So when you walk out a loser for a session but you're only a small loser,
you're making money. It doesn't seem feel like it at the time - when
you walk out of the casino with $300 less than you came in with you
don't think "this is improving my bottom line" you think "lousy
luck I blew $300 tonight". But there's a big difference between losing
$300, losing $600, losing $1000, losing $1500, losing $2000 and losing
$2200.

If you take a crushing loss, say $2000, your next three winning sessions
might not cover that. Consider these four sessions: -2000, +450, +600, +700.
You've had three good sessions but over the four sessions you're still -250.
If that -2000 session had been -1500, you'd be up +250 over the four. And
if that loss had been just -500, you're now +1250 after that good streak. So
losing less on your losing session has a real dollar effect on your profit.

You don't want to lose so much on a losing session that it takes you
three or four winning sessions to make it back.

The first author I've read who really gives this subject the attention it
deserves is the venerable Mike Caro, of Poker Tells fame. In Super/System 2,
Mike Caro presents a PowerPoint Slide Deck of 43 tips from "Mike Caro
University", MCU. I often wish MCU was a real institution that awarded Bachelor
of Poker degrees. Two of his tips are important here:

Tip #2 says: Money you don't lose buys just as many things as money you win.

Tip #15 is an important concept, Caro's "Threshold of Misery"; a big loss
threshold after which further losses don't really register any extra
pain. Losing $2200 isn't really more painful than losing $1500. But
there's a real money difference there.

Caro expands on the Threshold of Misery and other money ideas in his
gem of a book, "Caro's most Profitable Hold'em Advice: The Complete
Missing Arsenal". The Holdem advice is mainly on Limit Holdem and is
quite dated, but the money management and treat poker as a business
ideas are first rate.

Would you take $500 not to play poker tonight?
==============================================

Imagine a scenario where you got an offer of $500 to leave
the casino and not play poker tonight. Maybe you met a friend
who just won a tournament and wanted to share some winnings
with you, provided you went out and partied with him. Maybe your
office called and if you can drove there and did a cinch
thirty minute job they'd give you $500 in callout fees.
Easy money. You don't have to take the offer (your can party
another time with your mate, your office has other people they
can get to do the job) but the offer's there. Do you take it?

I think you should. $500 is nicely above your session average
in poker and here's a chance to make a guaranteed $500 by
simply not  playing poker.

I received an offer like this one night and I knocked it back.
I'd sat down at my 1/3 PLO table with my first $150 buyin and
my very first hand was a Party Hand, which I won with a non-nut
flush on the river. After 2 minutes at the table I had a stack
of $670.

OK, let's freeze time right there. I've played one hand, not well
and not badly, the cards fell my way and I've been gifted
$520 in winnings. I haven't got any read on what looks like
an averagely difficult table and I have an unspoken offer from
The Poker Gods of $520 to not play poker tonight. I can get home
early, do some things at home and get proper sleep. There's better
things to do in my life than play poker, so I should take the
$520 and have the earliest of nights.

The table didn't have any known chumps on it. If I keep playing
I could win well, win small, lose small or lose big. I could
see no easy money to be picked up, I'd need more big hands
and help from the cards to win more pots.

I didn't take the offer from the Poker Gods. I kept playing.

In this session I did win more pots to get my stack up to $920
but then lost a lot chasing an Open Ended Straight Draw. I got
as low as $220 but recovered to $420, when I cashed out for a
$270 win.

My high point was $920 which would've been a big $770 win and
a nice increase on that first hand $520 win. Going from $920
down to $220 was very bad and my final cashout figure of $420
for a $270 win feels about the right amount for the session.
The dollars don't lie. Still, I could've taken the offer
presented; $500 to not play poker tonight.

You can think of it as $500 compensation for missing out on the
rush and thrill and enjoyment of playing poker.

My Biggest Regrets
==================

My biggest regrets in PLO are all to do with my leaving decision.
I don't lose sleep over bad beats; I remember some of course
but bad beats are part and parcel of the game. What I do regret
are those nights where I was up $600 early; kept playing, lost
that $600 profit and my initial buyin and then lost plenty
more buyins as well. Instead of a $600 win I've put in a $1500 loss.
That's a $2100 downturn in real money.

Better decisions
================

Remember that as advantage gamblers we win by making better
decisions than the other players. The Leaving Decision is another
decision we can be better at than our enemies. The Leaving
Decision is entirely within your control. Make the best
Leaving Decision you can. If you're making bad leaving decisions,
have a think about your Leaving Decision Strategy and what mistakes
you might have made and what improvements you can make to it for
future sessions. You should be improving your poker game all the time
and improving your leaving decision is a vital part of that.

For the rest of this chapter I'll suggest a few leaving decision
strategies. You need to adopt these ideas and vary them into
something that works for you; maybe some ideas from Strategy A
mixed with Strategy B mixed with some ideas of your own.

Strategy A: $1000 this buyin
----------------------------

One method worth trying is to try and play each of your $150 buyins
up to $1000. Once your buyin gets around the $1000 amount
(in the $870-$1100 range) have a good think about your chip position
and whether it's time to call it a night.

For simplicity of this table, I'll assume each of your buyins is a
fixed $150 and you win 3 good hands in 40 minutes and your stack is
now $1000.

Buyin     In-for   Session position      Feeling
  1         150         +850             Blissful
  2         300         +700             Happy
  3         450         +550             Satisfied
  4         600         +400             Persistent
  5         750         +250             Justified
  6         900         +100             Deserved
  7        1050          -50             Take a small loss?
  8        1200         -200             Take manageable loss?
  9        1350         -350             Keep going
 10        1500         -500             Push on

My Feeling comments in the final column are very subjective, you'll feel
quite different to me and I haven't taken into account the table dynamics
which I'll look at in a later strategy.

There's a few downsides to my strategy, the worst being when you're $600
up on your first buyin but then get bad beated and end up losing $1200
when you could've walked away a $600 winner. If you like you can adjust
the table with a "leave for" column, like this:

Buyin     In-for   Leave if stack hits    For a profit of
  1        150          750                   +600
  2        300         1000                   +700
  3        450          900                   +450
  4        600         1000                   +400
and so on.

It's easier to play Omaha with a smaller stack than it is with a huge
stack. If you lose $150 in a party hand which ends up being a pot
of $590 to the winner it's only cost you that $150, but if you had
a big stack of $1150 it might cost you $150 into the main pot and
another $280 into a side pot against the eventual winner. You
stack has gone from $1150 to $720 and all of a sudden you're
on tilt and at risk of giving away the rest of your money unless
you hit some power hands, which doesn't always happen in Omaha
and certainly doesn't if you've lost your patience.

Strategy A recognises and reinforces my advice on how to play
a big stack in Cash Poker: Cash it out!!

THE LEAVING DECISION

Last updated: 20190729

Cash poker has an important element that Tournament Poker doesn't,
the Leaving Decision. In a tournament you have to play until you bust, or
you're the Last Man Standing or you make a final table deal and you're
one of the last Men standing. In Cash you can leave at any time, and
unless you're playing in the dead hours of the morning and the game
breaks, the game simply goes on without you after you leave.

From your point of view, the game is over once you leave it.
There's poker games going on 24x7, the only one you really care about
is the one you're playing in. You might glance at a mate playing
on the other table, or watch a big all-in pot on it when
the players there are making a bit of noise, but the game you
care about is your own.

The leaving decision is the most important decision you'll make in Cash
Poker. If I wrote about aspects of poker proportional to how important
they were to your winnings, there'd be 70% of the book about your
leaving decision and 30% PLO playing advice. Instead you're getting
90% PLO playing advice, 5% live Casino advice and 5% Leaving Decision
advice. Sorry about that. I'd love to bang on and on about how important
leaving at the right time is but it would just get repetitive.
Trust me, the leaving decision is the most important thing in cash poker.

This is an area of my game that needs a lot of improvement, and it's
also an area of the game that differs a lot between people.
We're all unique people; we've got different incomes, different
bankrolls and different personalities and risk profiles. A $600
loss to you will feel very different than it does to me. I don't have
all the answers to making the best leaving decision, but I'll write
some guidelines and give you a framework that you can use to develop
a system that works for you.

I'm going to shout it out one more time.

THE MOST PROFITABLE SINGLE CHANGE EXPERIENCED CASH GAME
PLAYERS CAN MAKE IS IMPROVING THEIR LEAVING DECISION

Public Games and Invitation Games
=================================

Because you're playing in a Casino environment, against
self-selecting players, you're playing in a Public Game.
Anyone with the right to be in the Casino can sign up to
the game and join it when their seat becomes available.
In a Public Game, you can leave the game with no notice
at any time that suits you. Simply take all your chips
from the table and turn them into beautiful cash.

Etiquette rules are different in Invitation Games and Home Games.
In these games you should announce your intention to leave
after a specified time. Normally half an hour or two or three
more rounds of the button is the right amount. You can then
"lock up your chips" by tank-folding every hand preflop and
not putting your chips at risk. You'll only lose three or so
big blinds and small blinds before you can cash out. This is
actually a lot harder to do than it sounds; inevitably you keep
looking at your hands and you'll play a few of them and maybe
get bad beated and lose a decent whack of your profit. A few
players have even reversed their leaving announcement and end up
playing the invitation game to the bitter end.

The Star do run a few Invitation Games, where you need to
be "in the know" to get in the game and they're not advertised
for general players to join. In these games you should
give the same notice of your intention to leave as in a home game.

Most of these invitation games are at megastakes; one of the
games is $100/$200/$400 PLO with a minimum buyin of $40,000
and no maximum! The one I've played in as a much more manageable
$1/$2/$5; which is a game Star used to run but then dropped so
that there were just two low-limit PLO games, $1/$3 and $5/$5/$10.

Some casinos don't run Invitation Games, all of their games
are open to anyone able to afford the minimum buyin for that
game. In "The Professor, The Banker and the Suicide King",
Michael Craig writes of Ted Forrest joining a $10,000/$20,000
Limit Holdem game at the Bellagio against Chip Reese and
an unknown rich player new in town, Andy Beal.
Expecting the biggest game going to be $400/$800, Forrest joined
a Public Game that was twenty-five times bigger.

Anyhow, when you play in the $1/$3 PLO game at Star, you're playing
in a Public game and you have the right to leave without notice at
any time. That is the most fundamental right of cash poker.

Hit and Run
===========

A Hit and Run is when you win a big pot and leave the
game immediately. You keep all the money you've just won
and don't risk losing any of it back.

Big Bet Poker (No Limit and Pot Limit games) are stack games
where you can get the whole of your stack involved in any one hand,
as long as you're in a pot with a player with a bigger stack
than yours. In most other forms of gambling, there's a set limit
to how much one gamble will cost you. You can play five spins of
a Poker Machine and know it will cost you $50, you can play
five hands of Blackjack and know it will cost you at most $100.
In Big Bet Poker, you don't know what the next five hands might
cost you. You run the risk of losing big in any hand.

To avoid losing back this beautiful money you've just won in
this big pot, simply Hit and Run. There is no penalty
(besides jibes from the other players) in Hit and Running from
a Public Game. You'll be allowed to play again the next time
you want to play, under the same waiting list rules that apply
to everyone else who wants to play in the game. Leave the
game whenever you want to.

The $100 Boundary Fallacy
=========================

Are you ever up $498 in your session and you're annoyed that
you haven't won Five Hundred Dollars? You want to push on
and win just three more dollars so you can say "I won over
Five Hundred Dollars in this session". This is one of the worst
risk/reward decisions in poker; you're risking your stack by
playing on to chase a tiny reward just because your brain tells
you that you're slightly under what would be a big win.

I suffer from this feeling all the time - and I'm good at Maths!
You know what the number just a bit under a Big Win is? A Big Win.
Take that big win.

Our brains are trained through advertising to think that
a car at $19,990 is under Twenty Thousand and that a book
priced at $19.95 is under Twenty Dollars. Well they're not;
you're paying $20,000 for the car and $20 for the book. Learn
to consider your $498 win as a $500 win and you'll be much better off.

Being good at Maths doesn't help me avoid the $100 Boundary
Fallacy because the Fallacy is much more of a Psychological
issue. I'm good at Maths, I'm shit at Psychology.

DOCTOR STRAIGHT FACT: The very night after I wrote this section
I played a session where my third buyin rose to great heights and
I was close to an overall win of $1000. In for $450, my stack was
$1420, $1502, $1440, $1449, $1410, $1435 and so on. I was keen
on getting it over $1450 so I could say I'd won $1000 in that
session then I remembered what I'd written in this section and
that a stack of $1440 effectively was a $1000 win. My cashout
amount was $1441, technically a $991 win but that's really
a $1000 win.

Don't keep a shorthanded game going
===================================

In the dead hours of the morning (4am and later) I sometimes find
myself at the final 1/3 PLO table and it's down to 6, 5 or 4
players and if two or even one more player leave the game will
break and there won't be any more 1/3 PLO action until the morning
game gets going which might not be until 10:30 or 11:00am.

Don't stay in this game just to keep it going if you're losing,
tired or playing badly. You're still playing in a Public Game.
It's not your fault that there's no players on the waiting list
and the game could die at any moment. It's not the Casino's fault
either, it's just a fact of real life poker you've got to deal with.

The Casino's not paying you to keep the game going and they're still
charging full rake. Some casinos have reduced rake for shorthanded
dead hours games, Star isn't one of them. You're probably getting tired
and there might not be much money on the table to win anyhow. Don't be
ashamed or afraid to call it a night.

Your next 100 sessions
======================

In the next few months you'll play 100 sessions of poker. I average
5 sessions a fornight, 12 a month so I'll probably have 100 sessions
done in the next 8 months. It might take you a year to play 100 sessions
or only 5 months, that's not important right now.

No matter how good you are, many of those 100 sessions will be losing
sessions. Let's say that 30 of your 100 sessions will be losers (and
that number's on the low side I think). Around a third of your sessions
you'll come out behind. Sometimes you'll win five sessions running and
you'll feel like the King of Poker, sometimes you'll lose three out of four
sessions and have a very expensive time of things.

After those hundred sessions you'll be up or down a certain amount.
Let's say you're up $6000. Nice play. Of course you wish you'd won
even more. The best way to have won more money is for your losing
sessions to be smaller.

If each one of your 30 losing sessions was one $150 buyin less,
you'd be up another $4500. Instead of being up $6000, you'd be up
$10500. Whatever your winning number was after those 100 sessions,
an extra $4500 would be noticed. You could be up $20000 and
that extra $4500 would still be significant.

So when you walk out a loser for a session but you're only a small loser,
you're making money. It doesn't seem feel like it at the time - when
you walk out of the casino with $300 less than you came in with you
don't think "this is improving my bottom line" you think "lousy
luck I blew $300 tonight". But there's a big difference between losing
$300, losing $600, losing $1000, losing $1500, losing $2000 and losing
$2200.

If you take a crushing loss, say $2000, your next three winning sessions
might not cover that. Consider these four sessions: -2000, +450, +600, +700.
You've had three good sessions but over the four sessions you're still -250.
If that -2000 session had been -1500, you'd be up +250 over the four. And
if that loss had been just -500, you're now +1250 after that good streak. So
losing less on your losing session has a real dollar effect on your profit.

You don't want to lose so much on a losing session that it takes you
three or four winning sessions to make it back.

The first author I've read who really gives this subject the attention it
deserves is the venerable Mike Caro, of Poker Tells fame. In Super/System 2,
Mike Caro presents a PowerPoint Slide Deck of 43 tips from "Mike Caro
University", MCU. I often wish MCU was a real institution that awarded Bachelor
of Poker degrees. Two of his tips are important here:

Tip #2 says: Money you don't lose buys just as many things as money you win.

Tip #15 is an important concept, Caro's "Threshold of Misery"; a big loss
threshold after which further losses don't really register any extra
pain. Losing $2200 isn't really more painful than losing $1500. But
there's a real money difference there.

Caro expands on the Threshold of Misery and other money ideas in his
gem of a book, "Caro's most Profitable Hold'em Advice: The Complete
Missing Arsenal". The Holdem advice is mainly on Limit Holdem and is
quite dated, but the money management and treat poker as a business
ideas are first rate.

Would you take $500 not to play poker tonight?
==============================================

Imagine a scenario where you got an offer of $500 to leave
the casino and not play poker tonight. You meet a friend
who just won a tournament and wants to share some winnings
with you, provided you go out and party with him. Your
office calls and if you drive there and do a cinch
thirty minute job they'll give you $500 in callout fees.
Easy money. You don't have to take the offer (your can party
another time with your mate, your office has other people they
can get to do the job) but the offer's there. Do you take it?

I think you should. $500 is nicely above your session average
in poker and here's a chance to make a guaranteed $500 by
simply not playing poker.

I received an offer like this one night and I knocked it back.
It didn't involve a party-hungry mate or my office calling up.
I'd sat down at my 1/3 PLO table with my first $150 buyin and
my very first hand was a Party Hand, which I won with a non-nut
flush on the river. After 2 minutes at the table I had a stack
of $670 and I'm up $520. Send it.

OK, let's freeze time right there. I've played one hand, not well
and not badly, it was a Party Hand and I know how to play those on my
first buyin, the cards fell my way and I've been gifted
$520 in winnings. I haven't got any read on what looks like
an averagely difficult table and I have an unspoken offer from
The Poker Gods of $520 to not play poker tonight. I can get home
early, do some things at home and get proper sleep. There's better
things to do in my life than play poker, so I should take the
$520 and have the earliest of nights.

The table didn't have any known chumps on it. If I keep playing
I could win well, win small, lose small or lose big. I can't
see any easy money to be picked up, I'd need more big hands
and help from the cards to win more pots.

I didn't take the offer from the Poker Gods. I kept playing.

In this session I did win more pots to get my stack up to $920
but then lost a lot chasing an Open Ended Straight Draw. I got
as low as $220 but recovered to $420, when I cashed out for a
$270 win.

My high point was $920 which would've been a big $770 win and
a nice increase on that first hand $520 win. Going from $920
down to $220 was very bad and my final cashout figure of $420
for a $270 win feels about the right amount for the session.
The dollars don't lie. Still, I could've taken the offer
presented; $520 to not play poker tonight.

You can think of it as $520 compensation for missing out on the
rush and thrill and enjoyment of playing poker.

My Biggest Regrets
==================

My biggest regrets in PLO are all to do with my leaving decision.
I don't lose sleep over bad beats; I remember some of course
but bad beats are part and parcel of the game. What I do regret
are those nights where I was up $600 early; kept playing, lost
that $600 profit and my initial buyin and then lost plenty
more buyins as well. Instead of a $600 win I've put in a $1500 loss.
That's a $2100 downturn in real money.

Better decisions
================

As an advantage gambler you win by making better
decisions than the other players. The Leaving Decision is another
decision where you can be better than the others. The Leaving
Decision is entirely within your control. Make the best
Leaving Decision you can. If you're making bad leaving decisions,
have a think about your Leaving Decision Strategy and what mistakes
you might have made and what improvements you can make to it for
future sessions. You should be improving your poker game all the time
and improving your leaving decision is a vital part of that.

For the rest of this chapter I'll suggest a few leaving decision
strategies. You need to adopt these ideas and vary them into
something that works for you; maybe some ideas from Strategy A
mixed with Strategy B mixed with some ideas of your own.

Strategy A: $1000 this buyin
----------------------------

One method worth trying is to try and play each of your $150 buyins
up to $1000. Once your buyin gets around the $1000 amount
(in the $870-$1100 range) have a good think about your chip position
and whether it's time to call it a night.

For simplicity of this table, I'll assume each of your buyins is a
fixed $150 and you win 3 good hands in 40 minutes and your stack is
now $1000.

Buyin     In-for   Session position      Feeling
  1         150         +850             Blissful
  2         300         +700             Happy
  3         450         +550             Satisfied
  4         600         +400             Persistent
  5         750         +250             Justified
  6         900         +100             Deserved
  7        1050          -50             Take a small loss?
  8        1200         -200             Take manageable loss?
  9        1350         -350             Keep going
 10        1500         -500             Push on

My Feeling comments in the final column are very subjective, you'll feel
quite different to me and I haven't taken into account the table dynamics
which I'll look at in a later strategy.

There's a few downsides to my strategy, the worst being when you're $600
up on your first buyin but then get bad beated and end up losing $1200
when you could've walked away a $600 winner. If you like you can adjust
the table with a "leave for" column, like this:

Buyin     In-for   Leave if stack hits    For a profit of
  1        150          750                   +600
  2        300         1000                   +700
  3        450          900                   +450
  4        600         1000                   +400
and so on.

It's easier to play Omaha with a smaller stack than it is with a huge
stack. If you lose $150 in a party hand which ends up being a pot
of $590 to the winner it's only cost you that $150, but if you had
a big stack of $1150 it might cost you $150 into the main pot and
another $280 into a side pot against the eventual winner. You
stack has gone from $1150 to $720 and all of a sudden you're
on tilt and at risk of giving away the rest of your money unless
you hit some power hands, which doesn't always happen in Omaha
and certainly doesn't if you've lost your patience.

Strategy A recognises and reinforces my advice on how to play
a big stack in Cash Poker: Cash it out!!

Strategy B: Table Characteristics
---------------------------------

How much money in on the table at the moment? There's usually
a lot of money on an Omaha table; but sometimes two big winners
have just cashed out, you've got a $240 stack and five other players
are left with stacks of $70-$160.

If there's no crazy on-tilt stuck players burning through buyin
after buyin, and the table is steady, there's probably not a lot
of money to be made in this game circumstance.

Another thing to look out for is if there are any chumps
or absolute Holdemites. If there are truly bad players
at the table, you should stick around and try to take the
easy money. Nothing at Omaha is easy, but on this rare
occasion there can be easier money than usual to pick up.

Strategy C: How tired are you?
------------------------------

I recommend Omaha sessions of four hours; much later than that
I get tired and lose focus. When I'm really tired I find myself
getting up from the table and walking around for the exercise,
waving my arms around and trying to get my blood flowing.

In my Uni days I did a lot of advanced Maths subjects.
The end of semester exams for these subjects were three to four hours
long, depending on how much different stuff was covered in the course.
The exams were long enough that slow handwriting speed wasn't a
factor and I really had plenty of time to finish the paper, and
to spend 40 minutes on the really tough questions and cross out
a few wrong first attempts if I was going down the garden path.

If the exams had been longer than four hours, that would have been
cruel. There was nothing I could have done going into the fifth hour
of the exam that I couldn't do in the first four. I was already
mentally exhausted after three hours of concentration, after four
hours I was very happy to call it a day.

In the same way, my poker sessions deteriorate going into the fourth
hour and the fifth hour. I can set my own hours and leave when I'm
getting tired.

When I'm really tired I get grumpy and the physical sound
of poker chips hitting each other as they're being thrown into the pot
starts to annoy me. The sound of people doing chip ruffling also gets
under my skin. That's a personal thing for me that I've noticed, and a
great biological sign that it should be time for me to wind things
up.

DOCTOR STRAIGHT FACT: I once called it a night after just
two hours at the table. It was a Friday night
session in a week where, after a long holiday
of wake-any-time-before-midday sleepins, I'd had to wake up
at 6am each morning. My body was still getting used to that
punishment and I just wasn't up to playing midnight to 4am.
My eyes were swimming and I cashed out before 2am, taking a
$450 win because my body just physically wasn't up to a late
night. When I got the cash at the payout counter, one of the $50 notes
looked strange, it was almost swimming in front of my eyes. A very
strange feeling indeed (luckily I was fine on the weekend after a good
sleepin, otherwise I would have gone to the see a Doctor). This was
the most exhasuted I've ever been at the table and I'd only been
playing two hours!

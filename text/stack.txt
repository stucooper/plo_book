STACK SIZE

Last Updated: 20190111

Your own stack size is an important consideration in
each hand of PLO. If your stack is less than $40 you
might want to add onto it, if you have chips spare
in your pocket. You have to add on to an amount in
the min-max buyin range of $100-$300; you can't add on
to a total of $95, neither can you add on to a total of
$320. 

$40 is a pretty useless stack size because even if
you triple-and-a-bit up you've still got just $140.
Whereas if you'd added on before your triple up
hand and still tripled up you'd now have a sweet $440.

$40 just isn't enough to become a big stack, when
you catch a winner. Once in a blue moon you'll get
a nice 6x Party Hands win with it and turn it into
$240, and maybe get Protection, but most of the time
it'll quietly vanish in a pretty useless losing all-in.

There is one good trick with a $40 stack, which is
a pre-flop step-raise to a bit more; which is an invitation
for someone with a good hand to give you protection and often
leaves you with an easy call into a juiced pot with bonus
dead money. You might have invested $40 to win a $163 pot
and you only have to beat one other player; there's been
two callers of the $40 who have been blasted out by
a big stack preflop.

THE RAKE

Last updated: 20180605 

The Star like most casinos take money out of each Cash pot as their
profit for providing the dealer, tables, shuffling machines, venue,
security and so on. Their rake is 10% on amounts $10 to $100
(rounded down), $10 flat on amounts $101 to $149 and $15 flat on
any amount $150 and above. For a $75 pot, the casino keeps $7
and gives the winner $68. For a $135 pot, they keep $10 and give
the winner $125. For a $240 pot, they keep $15 (their maximum
possible take) and give the winner $225.

When you win a small pot, that's clearly less than $150, it's
worth looking at how much rake the dealer takes out and checking
the final size of your pot, just to make sure the dealer hasn't
made a mistake and you're getting all the money you're entitled to.
If the dealer has raked $8, the pot must have been at 
least $80 before that rake was taken out, so the pot passed to you 
should be at least $72. Dealers are very good at figuring the rake
out but I normally find 2 or 3 mistakes a month, never more than
$1 or $2 here and there, but like I said it's worth getting
every dollar you deserve.

    15                      135                    all the chips on the table 

Since the game is 1/3 and there's always at least a big blind posted; 
the minumum pot being contested is $3 and if everyone folds in this
situation the big blind gets an unraked $3 back. The smallest possible
pot is $3.

An uncalled bet that gets everyone to fold and wins the pot
is returned to the bettor and doesn't get counted towards the rake.
But an uncalled raise that wins a pot has the "call" part of that
bet counted towards the rake. Example: The small blind bets $30
at a $50 pot, several players fold and the button raises to $130.
After some thought the small blind folds and the button wins the pot.
The rakeable part of this pot is $50+$30+$30: the Button's raise
was "I call your $30 and raise you another $100". That $100 is
what is returned to the raiser and not raked, but the call of $30 is.
You can't announce your bet as "I call.. and raise" because of the
ban on String Betting. Some dealers miss this subtlety and return
the whole uncalled $130 bet to the button and rake this $80 pot $8
instead of raking the $110 pot $10. This dealer error works in
favour of the players.

Sometimes a player I don't like very much puts in a big check raise
on the flop, wins that pot and the dealer misses taking the full rake.
I'll quickly point this out to the dealer and make sure the right
rake is taken. This is a pretty fun needle - it's amazing how annoyed
some people get when they miss out on a few dollars of free money.

In hands with main pots and side pots, the main pot is raked first and
once $15 of rake has been collected there's no more rake taken. This
is a real bonus for big stacks who compete for a big side pot rake-free.
There might be a short staked guy whose $40 quadruples to $160, he wins
the main pot but he pays the $15 rake, while two big stacks have a $450
side pot which one of them wins rake free.

Star dealers take a few seconds to stack the pots in $100 towers so
you can see how big it is. While this makes the dealing a bit
slower, it saves the players a lot of brainpower in not having
to keep track of the pot size.

Once the pot is huge and obviously a lot more than $150, some dealers
will take three $5 chips and put them well away from the main pot,
usually on top of the first burn card.
Then once the pot is awarded, the rake is ready to put in the tray
and the rest of the pot is easily pushed to the winner.

Obviously the bigger the pots you're pulling in, the less effect
rake is having on you. If you keep winning little $80 pots then
you're paying 10% each time but if you're winning big $400 pots then
that $15 taken out is almost inconsequential. Rake starts being an
issue in dead-of-morning shorthanded games, where three $400 stacks
are passing $60 pots around backwards and forwards and the casino
is fully raking the 10% each time. If the pots are small and the
rake is starting to bite and everyone's stacks are slowly shrinking,
it could be time to call it a night.

Some casinos offer reduced rake when games are shorthanded. The Star 
isn't one of these casinos and they rake the full amounts described
here under all 1/3 PLO circumstances.

Before February 2018, Star had a "time charge + rake" structure
which I'll briefly describe. The time charge was $5/hour, which
reduced a bit over time depending what time you joined the table
(10pm: $5, 10:12pm: $3, 10:23pm: $2; 10:47pm: free until 11:00pm).
The rake was 10% to a maximum of $10. Provided you won two
big pots per hour you were better off with the old Time Charge,
because on your big pots your rake was $10+$10+$5 time charge = $25
but now your rake is $15+$15+$0 time charge = $30.

The huge PLO games, with $1000 and more minimum buyins, still
have a time charge: $25/hour plus rake until the table has made
$350 in rake for the hour. After that the pots are rake free until
the end of the hour. I don't play that big so I won't bother
figuring out the maths. I sometimes play a 5/5/10 PLO game;
this game uses the same $0 time charge and 10% cap, maximum
$15 rake as the 1/3 game does.

The rake structure here works identically in 2/3 NLH. Most of
the dealers try to use the $1 chips in the pot for the rake,
so they've always got plenty in their tray to give change with. 
Sometimes a winning player is asked by the dealer for some $1 chips
to make the rake quicker.. if you're winning a $70 pot that's
all in red chips the dealer will ask you for two $1 chips,
keep one of the red $5 chips and those two $1 chips as
the $7 rake and pass you the $65 rest of the pot. Effectivly
it's cost you $2 to get a $65 pot passed to you, so you're
winning a $63 post-rake pot.

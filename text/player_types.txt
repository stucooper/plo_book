PLAYER TYPES

Last updated: 20191202

Poker is a game of people and you should be adjusting your play based
on your observations of other players in the pot. Remember that Omaha
is a nut-hand game, so you shouldn't be in the pot at all unless
you've got a great hand or a draw to the Nuts. There's less bluffing
in Omaha than Holdem because it's so much easier to make hands.
That said, there's a few player types you'll find at the tables.

Maniac preflop raisers
======================

Some players will raise and re-raise the pot preflop, even
without looking at their cards. They'd like to take some early
chances to win some big pots, even at risk of giving away a few
buyins while playing unseen trash. In Omaha it's rare for any 4-card
holding to be less than a 30% chance against any other 4-card holding,
even when the other 4-card holding has been looked at and the player's
decided it's worth seeing a flop for this huge price.

The Maniac Preflop Raisers are showing off their indifference to losing
a few buyins; some crazy guys will buyin for the full $300 each time
and still do no-look preflop raises. They normally quieten down after
a round or two. Unless you're dealt a monster hand you can really
go to war with, you just have to wait them out.

A lot of the Maniac Preflop Raisers are Five-Five Refugees. The
maximum buyin of $300 at 1/3 is the Minimum buyin of the 5/5 game,
so $300 just isn't much to them. The 5/5 buyin range is $300-$1500.

Calling Stations
================

There's not as many calling stations as you find in Holdem, because
calling big river bets in Omaha wipes your buyins out very quickly.
In Holdem a big river bet can sometimes be a bluff and can be hero-called,
in Omaha it's so easy to make big hands that the person putting in
a big river bet is more often selling the Nuts at a high price and
not bluffing. There are a lot less "call down" hands in Omaha than
there are in Holdem. In Holdem you'd often call down with a set when there's
only three to a flush or straight on the board, in Omaha you'd often 
fold the set here and you'd always fold a hand like bottom two pair.

Megatight 
=========

For a few months in the 1/3 PLO game there were regulars who were megatight
preflop. You'd think they were being dealt KT72 or 333J every hand
they were folding so much. They can't have been getting that many
unplayable hands that often, it looked like they must have been waiting
for either AAKK double suited or AAJT double suited.

Needless to say, when they entered the pot nobody at the table gave
them much action (unless they cracked them on the flop). A lot of
the people in the game (including myself) were needling these guys
for never playing a hand.

We're not genius card readers at 1/3 but we do notice a player who
folds 90% of his hands who suddenly comes out of nowhere in a new
hand with a pot-sized raise.

The megatight players have dropped out of the game but they
might be back. I don't think it's an effective way of playing PLO.
The megatight player I remember the most used to pot raise when he
had a playable hand, but you could call that pot raise for $15 or $20
and outdraw him a lot of the time, or take a small loss when the flop
missed you. It was still worthwhile taking a flop against him a lot
of the time. He could've improved his game by taking a limp/pot-reraise
strategy on his big hands and limped into some more pots with his
average hands.

Deadstack Nothreats
===================

These are just about my favourite players at the table. They put you
under very little pressure and their stacks are so insignificant
that even when they do make a hand it doesn't cost you too much to
try to outdraw them and doesn't cost you much if you lose. Their
stacks never seem to get bigger than $200; and are normally in the $40-$140
range. Often they'll bet pot (which is close to all-in for them) on the
flop and you'll have a very easy decision to make. Again, it doesn't
cost you much if you call and the runout goes against you (or if your
read was wrong and you were virtually drawing dead).

A flop push from a small deadstack is often from a 2-pair hand (I'll make
this move myself if I have a smallish stack and flop two pair) so you can
call down with as little as a naked flush draw, middle pair with 2 or 3 overs
(giving you good enough chances of making higher two pair). You get to
Showdown, which means you get the full chance of sneaking any backdoor
draws you have (and they do come in sometimes). 

Sometimes I'll isolate-reraise against the deadstack's push; this gets me 
heads-up against a probably average hand, though it's dangerous if a
third person in the pot was sandbagging a set or some massive draw. It's
stack killing having a good read on the deadstack being weak but then
giving your chips away to a third player who doesn't go away. If you'd
flat called, the sandbagger would then come over the top and you'd be able
to save lots of money. So unless you're super strong yourself, just flat
call the deadstack and a lot of the time you'll end up heads-up anyway.

The Maniacs have too much gamble in them, the Deadstacks don't have
enough. They're rarely involved in Megapots, because they never have
a $700 stack to commit into a huge pot in the first place. They're not
very active players.

Aunties
=======

An Aunty is a middle-aged Asian woman. There's three or four of them
who are regulars in the game. They're Nut Peddlars and raise the pot
once they hit their hand. One of the regular Aunties bets or
raises the pot by saying "Pot-aaah!" when it's her turn to act.
Aunties sometimes raise with huge draws which you can also fold to
unless you've got the current nuts like top set.

Nut Peddlars
============

Some players won't bet on the river without the absolute Nuts.
It's just not in their nature to bet themselves without holding
an unbeatable hand. They will call with non-nut flushes and
secondary straights and top sets, but they won't bet them
when they're not the nut hands.

This means that when they DO bet, they're betting the nuts.
Unless you've also got the nuts, you can safely fold.

Drunks
======

Believe it or not, there's a few drinkers who play in the game
sometimes. You know what you've heard about drunks being bad
poker players? It's all true.
